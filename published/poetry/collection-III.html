The army of flies and the crosshairs, the imaginary passages, disguised rites, and the cloud windows of fret. The perturbations that sting, ones distracting, in tingling and easing, to call out the aim from the mist of waffle, holding intangible never found unzealousness. I get the spite for my method, with being by the time; educated to my purpose.</p>\n<p>The far bits are old marks, common detritions of how better my character’s voice would play out, if I was more about them or better adjusted employing a clever call, sing my words not so infatuated. Unintentional questions slamming . . . doesn’t her caress peg your next yen valuable for a suction? If it is a suction? if I can afford it?</p>\n<p>Yes, it does, by a lie. Do I tell of my love and its pride, its groaning? I want more is its overbearing indulgence against the de rigueur, her's too in the obstinate twill that has made this book possible. I am penning another collection to waylay. Love has always been about what is right, I believe its orthodoxy is marriage. Who doesn’t agree, doesn’t get the sappy red, the apogee, or any of why scribblings bicker, get their titter when I arrive, and dupe forever why else their eyes are late.</p>\n<p>Collection III (Valentine Edition) makes me front, it is my third, a valentine posture, calm and unresponsive to the candour of the illiterate. Mariam Rod brings skids to my hopes. So to the celebrated inselberg, let the drums roll. 🥁</p>\n<p>Happy Valentine Mariam Rod. </p>\n"

      <h2>Foreword</h2>
      <div>
        <p>It has taken a long time putting my best words together, getting to what I mean. The army of flies and the crosshairs, the imaginary passages, disguised rites, and the cloud windows of fret. The perturbations that sting, ones distracting, in tingling and easing, to call out the aim from the mist of waffle, holding intangible never found unzealousness. I get the spite for my method, with being by the time; educated to my purpose.</p>
        <p>The far bits are old marks, common detritions of how better my character’s voice would play out, if I was more about them or better adjusted employing a clever call, sing my words not so infatuated. Unintentional questions slamming . . . doesn’t her caress peg your next yen valuable for a suction? If it is a suction? if I can afford it?</p>
        <p>Yes, it does, by a lie. Do I tell of my love and its pride, its groaning? I want more is its overbearing indulgence against the de rigueur, her's too in the obstinate twill that has made this book possible. I am penning another collection to waylay. Love has always been about what is right, I believe its orthodoxy is marriage. Who doesn’t agree, doesn’t get the sappy red, the apogee, or any of why scribblings bicker, get their titter when I arrive, and dupe forever why else their eyes are late.</p>
        <p>Collection III (Valentine Edition) makes me front, it is my third, a valentine posture, calm and unresponsive to the candour of the illiterate. Mariam Rod brings skids to my hopes. So to the celebrated inselberg, let the drums roll. 🥁</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine Mariam Rod. </p>

        <p>Looking out the cab, I was high as a kite.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>“That’s a prick.” Hymen debate. “Can I?”</p>
        <p>Sitting room floor wet in smudge sigh</p>
        <p>My high had doubled after we dined</p>
        <p>I wanted to, but her truth I imbibed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The memory stir dried out my brine</p>
        <p>Bed peace from Wale’s Vanity dry</p>
        <p>Tramadol 100mg and seizure hide</p>
        <p>Protecting me from the regicide</p>
        <p>A heartbreak detour, a coleoptile</p>
        <p>I was suffering in convulsive pine.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Easement and the loss of exam’s stile</p>
        <p>One in, and to go, the week’s whine</p>
        <p>“Drop the tramadol pills, come fly”</p>
        <p>“Dup weed to thoughts that edify”</p>
        <p>“Edibles is right, to find the height.”</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Days, Robert had the halls’ mood high</p>
        <p>The Hallelujah chorus booming incise.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>On top bunk ill, her response in sight</p>
        <p>“No.” it read, another that mad night</p>
        <p>Nothing cut through, remaining swine</p>
        <p>It wasn’t me, time was slow and fine</p>
        <p>It wasn’t my room still I had no gripes</p>
        <p>The air was real, his body warm, nice</p>
        <p>Mo special but the screen a dead line</p>
        <p>Every text sent, back in “No.” decline.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The chorus booming again and up in tide</p>
        <p>Augury before, now a lover asking why</p>
        <p>I’d never met her; past by the halls, shy</p>
        <p>Her blare out there, here but never eye</p>
        <p>I could hear her now, in very faint chime</p>
        <p>In my head, as a portcullis shielding kinds</p>
        <p>Moving away, I had to find Robert, say hi.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Too beautiful to be lost in a stinky fight</p>
        <p>A vernal night, and its call; ember ignite</p>
        <p>Up from his side, with a wall cold like ice</p>
        <p>Semblance from his memory stir a flight</p>
        <p>I got away from that place, leaving for life</p>
        <p>My room months ago, it was the turnpike.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Felling warm, gay, wholesome, and a child</p>
        <p>Leaving with grace a “No.” could not hide</p>
        <p>By the bunk intimating to my ear: the light</p>
        <p>As a boombox my iPhone blew in oh might</p>
        <p>The aural waves doozie in colour so bright</p>
        <p>Faint ruddy, green, and purple long stripes</p>
        <p>Bordering sides to a new tread board sign.</p>

        <p>Whom called to me, and implored</p>
        <p>Nothing to lose, to get her spunk</p>
        <p>Lash the big body men too butt.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It went on, satisfying astricting smug</p>
        <p>By sex, with her height, a lot ’d blur</p>
        <p>Her patience, my conscience factor.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>And here, by my locker, dawn</p>
        <p>The male teacher quarters’ hut</p>
        <p>Panty in hand, she goes, pours</p>
        <p>Good morn. Maybe so, burnt</p>
        <p>It was too early, scenic error</p>
        <p>She’d lost her pants, and what?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Someone had to inform, report</p>
        <p>I poured it out, every suggestion</p>
        <p>A lengthy prowl sent to the box</p>
        <p>The suggestion box was small</p>
        <p>But I had just joined the club</p>
        <p>My first note was about faults.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I stood in wait, gentle in cloth</p>
        <p>The night brought a wild draw</p>
        <p>A feral grit instinct production</p>
        <p>No one is ugly in the dark fog.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It was that she’d traced my flaws</p>
        <p>I saw hers, head like a new figure</p>
        <p>She smelled good, but too, dumb</p>
        <p>It wasn’t erotic, it didn’t perturb</p>
        <p>What did was what I had in funds</p>
        <p>It wasn’t enough to smash, cum</p>
        <p>The business on the dick by a stud</p>
        <p>In the dark there, I couldn’t hump</p>
        <p>Thoughts of a stolen book, more</p>
        <p>All that money to stroke her bust</p>
        <p>The classroom gave a mind fuck</p>
        <p>Its resemblance to a library floor</p>
        <p>The treasure floor always locked</p>
        <p>Where I fapped once, awkward</p>
        <p>I did, cos I had read well enough</p>
        <p>Only another interest for a fop</p>
        <p>So I let naked figures play fort.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I paid her, but how? I cannot recall</p>
        <p>Not mean, she let me some clomp</p>
        <p>Pressing my business behind in gruff</p>
        <p>All the time seeing her take my prong</p>
        <p>Slowly spitting and sucking the knob.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When I came, two was caught</p>
        <p>Mind clarity and a sweet influx</p>
        <p>Then her face, some tiny disgust</p>
        <p>Oh the library, the now old stomp</p>
        <p>She’d sent a latitat for my attention.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Ahmed took one too many pictures</p>
        <p>Rummy for me, being male I thought</p>
        <p>With my Adonis face cut in the crop</p>
        <p>I’m bought.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>He’d go on, yapping ‘bout postures</p>
        <p>Saying: how you’re reposed is sure</p>
        <p>However you find yourself in gulf</p>
        <p>Play ball.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Asking Moyo, he is no way at all a cross</p>
        <p>Classmates and best friends, their bond</p>
        <p>Six years together in high school’s jaw</p>
        <p>I was a senior.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The days we’d no ties were a pleasure</p>
        <p>Both athletes, so we met during sports</p>
        <p>Sprint, beating me by a tiny gap to first</p>
        <p>Oh his burst.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Often klatsch to smoke weed and talk</p>
        <p>Skunk air, money moves, high fantods </p>
        <p>He’d those by him, blacks with the pot</p>
        <p>Not visitors.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Once, perched on a tree, he implored</p>
        <p>In a sudden halt, of jeopardy, our turf</p>
        <p>An eponym, the venue he’d demurred</p>
        <p>He’d a mix-up.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Hellfire had bellowed at him a concuss</p>
        <p>Compromised orphically, mind fraught</p>
        <p>Quickly he douts his spliff in a full stop</p>
        <p>Triggered taut.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In hackling pule bye, he left the meetup</p>
        <p>Harlem sunset, the man loved the buds</p>
        <p>It was not the first time, but this struck;</p>
        <p>That chord.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Everyone wanted to leave town abroad</p>
        <p>He discussed plans if he struck a windfall</p>
        <p>With college degree foreign, not em duds</p>
        <p>He’d warn.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We had Hellfire, and also another Rooftop</p>
        <p>Hellfire had a shrine, house made of mud</p>
        <p>Rooftop, a home; hotel dream shutdown</p>
        <p>By a despot.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Evenings saw me over there on weed puff</p>
        <p>Two spliffs, I’m buzzing with objecting buts</p>
        <p>I left headachy, thoughts on what’s install</p>
        <p>But I enjoyed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>His Rooftop visits are points of sparse blurs</p>
        <p>He introduced me to his friend, not the club</p>
        <p>In the pictures taken, his lips held a gesture</p>
        <p>As of more.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Once with lips sucked in so long, he spouts</p>
        <p>If I would care to swap jeans, “It is grunge.”</p>
        <p>“A black knee-ripped dungaree” in a surge</p>
        <p>“Your court.”</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Stuttering as I sometimes do, I stop, pause</p>
        <p>No longer in memory now; by that I let up</p>
        <p>He wanted what I had on, and for my notch</p>
        <p>Something smut.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Stonewash and a naked knee from a big gut</p>
        <p>Back having it, with a better upkeep purse</p>
        <p>I’d go down on my left knee, say the words</p>
        <p>Mariam, let’s have fun.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Seeking fun is not everything; it is the call</p>
        <p>Pleasure pairs with fun and it’s on the run</p>
        <p>In the morning it’s coffee, at night it’s rum</p>
        <p>A never humdrum.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I smoked weed for years before the breakup</p>
        <p>Twenty-one when I drew the first short puff</p>
        <p>Twenty-five and I couldn’t go on, not till dust</p>
        <p>Our divorce.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>But before then, pleasure took me on tour</p>
        <p>Without Mariam, pals on the blame stub</p>
        <p>To say I did, we visited a brothel slash pub</p>
        <p>To end my grunts.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>First time having hashish, lain next to a boy</p>
        <p>Wishes of it being a girl, for he dealt fudge</p>
        <p>He’d done it, he transcended, saw a whore</p>
        <p>A pivotal point.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Final summer we left campus for a reunion</p>
        <p>An old mate who’d left a fresher-abandon</p>
        <p>He lost his closer friends then to expulsion</p>
        <p>He dealt drugs.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>He said he left because he got really bored</p>
        <p>Few Messenger messages, we had to claw</p>
        <p>We made plans to meet, it felt not so long</p>
        <p>He decked the halls.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Joshua not long threw a fit, fit for a jock</p>
        <p>Everything has been wrong from the jump</p>
        <p>Even the car broke. Drawing my attention</p>
        <p>Continuing in bug.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>We’d just concluded our finals, no touch ups</p>
        <p>Freedom. End of university. End of lectures</p>
        <p>And a wuss who’s known, laid whores, bucks?</p>
        <p>He had my wits gone.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I’m hopeless romantic with the underworld</p>
        <p>He gets up to leave, so I follow him on abut</p>
        <p>He’s the one who’d done it; I play the bong</p>
        <p>I needed to. I must.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Just out. A thing amiss I could not tell at all</p>
        <p>That my phone was missing, it had dropped</p>
        <p>Bode handed it to me in good augur launch</p>
        <p>The worker wasn’t buff.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Nothing changed in that town and I got a job</p>
        <p>An initial hotel accommodation with hotspot</p>
        <p>My office was nearby, I was on a row of luck</p>
        <p>It was a pleasant adjust.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>My new town on the scale, was a good bump</p>
        <p>A conducive estate, featuring relevant shops</p>
        <p>Quiet mornings with a keen sense impetuous</p>
        <p>For the doors!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>A new Apple Mac with mountains for desktop</p>
        <p>One afternoon, my FaceTime got a cool buzz</p>
        <p>It was unexpected in every way, a total prong</p>
        <p>An employer usurp.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Longer conversations later through the duct</p>
        <p>Days after, I got money and very good cause</p>
        <p>Spending more than the month’s earn sum</p>
        <p>So I raised the crump.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Most nights, we get a drop to the same spot</p>
        <p>Light another one up, because it is that just</p>
        <p>Pepsi Cola, great skunk, and live music pump</p>
        <p>Pass the buck.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Relaxed with friends and a colleague from work</p>
        <p>Ideas we never heard flowed in slow prologue</p>
        <p>Action figure said no to excitement and crutch</p>
        <p>Fuck this crawl!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>He wasn’t a coward, he balled hard, a dawg</p>
        <p>He’d sex whenever around, had no remorse</p>
        <p>A field player since his first income catapult</p>
        <p>No blotch.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Oh I just couldn’t have the habit on staunch</p>
        <p>He’d leave, my colleague was taking a drop</p>
        <p>For his hotel, we for the ATM to get blunt</p>
        <p>Following our plot.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Two luxury bedrooms to my name by dawn</p>
        <p>A tart’s iPhone on the bed, how she forgot?</p>
        <p>Out of the plot, a gang bang was her employ</p>
        <p>I too felt lost.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Another time, another place, for another shot</p>
        <p>To reignite the plot, I had just received a wand</p>
        <p>Action figure had been around, counting sluts</p>
        <p>Leaving me the clot.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Man, what do we do tonight? To me like a report</p>
        <p>. . . we should hit the club. He suggests with force</p>
        <p>No, I can't tolerate the music, smoke what I want.</p>
        <p>I returned in a punch.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Let’s get a whore, stay at home, smoke rocks</p>
        <p>It’ll be a gang bang, I’ll call up Chvrch my plug</p>
        <p>We were at a bar, waiting for meals; in decision</p>
        <p>Let’s hunt!</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Using a choice service we got through the worst</p>
        <p>Met up with Chvrch for a gram of the stain blob</p>
        <p>Headed back to my apartment, ready for the fluff</p>
        <p>I was soon left in a lurch.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Action figure in the bedroom treats women as gum</p>
        <p>He chews them, pops them, and loves their engulf</p>
        <p>He’s in the bedroom, I’m in the toilet, and I’m stuck</p>
        <p>He’s the one focused.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>An evening in my office, ring! My phone’s blurt</p>
        <p>Thirteen seconds of his hand gripping a fat bum</p>
        <p>Straight from the soda shop, with no blip of fuss</p>
        <p>A straight boss.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Oh, I couldn’t leave, the girl brought in no joy</p>
        <p>Her long eye lashes told me off like a soy boy</p>
        <p>And when he came in, it wasn’t at all for rush</p>
        <p>Here I was, PC Plod.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>He had burnt a tiny amount, alive, and in store</p>
        <p>I am fine by this. A smile on his face as a duck</p>
        <p>My headphones made love to me like a faggot</p>
        <p>If I could see the bulge?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Then he was done, and he was around for a burn</p>
        <p>Meaning also, it was time I went for my own turn</p>
        <p>A sort of gang bang? I sensed a no daring bunch</p>
        <p>I’d stalled, for a flop.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>As if facing the music, I branch out summoned</p>
        <p>A nog to what is rising and push for a mugshot</p>
        <p>He’d be there as I fucked her to watch me cum</p>
        <p>That’s the stuff.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>With my pellet in, I in no time get a full stun</p>
        <p>I didn’t get it, I had on rubber, a good condom</p>
        <p>But it wasn’t real, definitely a thing was wrong</p>
        <p>I was in top crumb.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I was scared, I drew out, seeing her visage fond</p>
        <p>A second scare, it was dark and I couldn’t trust</p>
        <p>Maybe I fucked her, maybe I didn’t, can’t recall</p>
        <p>It’s a blank cloche.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Pleasure chase is everything; it isn’t always yum</p>
        <p>The hedonist serves the animal and it, his word</p>
        <p>Action figure told me all about his favourite toy</p>
        <p>An app you don’t grub.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Who will be the incel in society? Him why not.</p>
        <p>They need someone, but I found you; that’s love</p>
        <p>Like an ad, walking me through his chatting hub</p>
        <p>In measure, a tailor.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I got a girl, had her once, a time for a second</p>
        <p>She loved it, it seemed, she called, I blocked</p>
        <p>A jolly session, I pondered my condom off</p>
        <p>Oh, oh, oh her buns.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I no longer own those old rip jeans anymore</p>
        <p>But I could buy one, better, get a franchisor</p>
        <p>It could be a free rip jean brand distributor</p>
        <p>To Mariam’s love.</p>

        <p>Careful I blot thought</p>
        <p>Of you not wrought.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Tramp stopped short</p>
        <p>Your silent beaut cot.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Vehement ridiculous</p>
        <p>Of a pensive torch</p>
        <p>Beaming in foist flush.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Sidling ghosting shawl</p>
        <p>My caught oppy love</p>
        <p>In crease that isn’t much</p>
        <p>The knee punch not worth</p>
        <p>See your legs, not touch</p>
        <p>Between all near hurt.</p>

      <div>
        <p>For how long have I had to wear a cap?</p>
        <p>Twenty-four.</p>
        <p>If that’s a year for every hour of the day</p>
        <p>A do-rag?</p>
        <p>It’s okay to say I sleep with my cap donned.</p>
        <p>I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover</p>
        <p>No beautiful long locks like Samson</p>
        <p>So you don’t spot my strength.</p>
        <p>Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini</p>
        <p>So you don’t pick out my valour.</p>
        <p>Scars and bars, a tale starting age six.</p>
        <p>I hide scars though detained within bars</p>
        <p>Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell</p>
        <p>A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I think when I am older . . .</p>
        <p>“Older” seems like a hold on the change I await</p>
        <p>The ums in circle of my own social weight</p>
        <p>The moral of my own morale.</p>
        <p>Starting from just us two</p>
        <p>A ball, a light fixture, a veranda</p>
        <p>I’m six, she’s three years old</p>
        <p>The ball isn’t ours, it is lost</p>
        <p>Over the fence it came like a gift.</p>
        <p>Back from school days after</p>
        <p>I am alone and up in the air above me</p>
        <p>It hits a glass light-fixture.</p>
        <p>Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock</p>
        <p>White shirt fused in red gush of blood</p>
        <p>Soaking . . . soon I am back to.</p>
        <p>At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong.</p>
        <p>I have a picture at seven</p>
        <p>I have an oversized watch</p>
        <p>And a scar</p>
        <p>No cap.</p>
        <p>It asks when I’ll go without a cap</p>
        <p>Give back the oversized watch to the photographer.</p>
        <p>The one who is three thinks she did it</p>
        <p>Cos I lied.</p>
        <p>“You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.”</p>
        <p>“And it came down.”</p>
        <p>The real fall comes from who broke the thing.</p>
        <p>For us.</p>
        <p>She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best</p>
        <p>“I lied back then.”</p>
        <p>How best do I know with my cap on now?</p>
        <p>I’ll be thirty soon.</p>
        <p>When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat</p>
        <p>I tried a new haircut and a friend told me</p>
        <p>“Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.”</p>
        <p>What has changed?</p>
        <p>I convince myself it’s the nutrients</p>
        <p>But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars.</p>
        <p>The holding back; to a time I dream of</p>
        <p>A time like the past I won’t remember</p>
        <p>Six could be wrong, three could be right</p>
        <p>If I don’t do something.</p>
        <p>I did.</p>
        <p>I recorded a public video with no cap</p>
        <p>And now I know all the help I can get.</p>
        <p>To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.</p>

            `<p class="ql-align-justify"><span class="dropcap text-dark">I</span>t has taken a long time putting my best words together, getting to what I mean. The army of flies and the crosshairs, the imaginary passages, disguised rites, and the cloud windows of fret. The perturbations that sting, ones distracting, in tingling and easing, to call out the aim from the mist of waffle, holding intangible never found unzealousness. I get the spite for my method, with being by the time; educated to my purpose.</p>
              
              <p class="ql-align-justify">The far bits are old marks, common detritions of how better my character’s voice would play out, if I was more about them or better adjusted employing a clever call, sing my words not so infatuated. Unintentional questions slamming . . . doesn’t her caress peg your next yen valuable for a suction? If it is a suction? if I can afford it?</p>
              
              <p class="ql-align-justify">Yes, it does, by a lie. Do I tell of my love and its pride, its groaning? I want more is its overbearing indulgence against the de rigueur, her's too in the obstinate twill that has made this book possible. I am penning another collection to waylay. Love has always been about what is right, I believe its orthodoxy is marriage. Who doesn’t agree, doesn’t get the sappy red, the apogee, or any of why scribblings bicker, get their titter when I arrive, and dupe forever why else their eyes are late.</p>
              
              <p class="ql-align-justify">Collection III (Valentine Edition) makes me front, it is my third, a valentine posture, calm and unresponsive to the candour of the illiterate. Mariam Rod brings skids to my hopes. So to the celebrated inselberg, let the drums roll. 🥁</p>
              
              <p class="ql-align-justify">Happy Valentine Mariam Rod. </p>

<p>Bella, Dec 26 saw a movie and quite</p>
<p>She had a dude warm her lonely side</p>
<p>I had promised Xmas, delivering a bite</p>
<p>It’d showed my failure taking to diarize</p>
<p>I was a no-show, I was home pondering</p>
<p>A break-up rede, it was apt, convincing</p>
<p>Labelling her a witch as if inadvertently</p>
<p>Our long chats now an unhealthy beguile</p>
<p>Come Dec 27, she was ex and prehensile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We never met.” How he met my mind</p>
<p>Reminding me... she used to be mine </p>
<p>And I lost the grease, to a topple plight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speakers chorusing on amen for miles</p>
<p>Hidden nifty indoors, lying fine supine</p>
<p>Fellatio, while the elderly played blind</p>
<p>Our second time intimate, also out wild</p>
<p>Bella’s stop at the church’s yearly chide</p>
<p>Now waned, I defected from being trite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our first time left me with a grim insight</p>
<p>Still on towel, I scoped close my new find</p>
<p>I arrived sorta early, I thought in a smile</p>
<p>SpongeBob tee soaking away any slight</p>
<p>Her face blemishes didn’t ruin the hype</p>
<p>Her voice drooling out in an oily strike</p>
<p>Known pitch matching her towel in sly</p>
<p>Just out of the bathroom at my alight</p>
<p>Looking out the cab, I was high as a kite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s a prick.” Hymen debate. “Can I?”</p>
<p>Sitting room floor wet in smudge sigh</p>
<p>My high had doubled after we dined</p>
<p>I wanted to, but her truth I imbibed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The memory stir dried out my brine</p>
<p>Bed peace from Wale’s Vanity dry</p>
<p>Tramadol 100mg and seizure hide</p>
<p>Protecting me from the regicide</p>
<p>A heartbreak detour, a coleoptile</p>
<p>I was suffering in convulsive pine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Easement and the loss of exam’s stile</p>
<p>One in, and to go, the week’s whine</p>
<p>“Drop the tramadol pills, come fly”</p>
<p>“Dup weed to thoughts that edify”</p>
<p>“Edibles is right, to find the height.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Days, Robert had the halls’ mood high</p>
<p>The Hallelujah chorus booming incise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On top bunk ill, her response in sight</p>
<p>“No.” it read, another that mad night</p>
<p>Nothing cut through, remaining swine</p>
<p>It wasn’t me, time was slow and fine</p>
<p>It wasn’t my room still I had no gripes</p>
<p>The air was real, his body warm, nice</p>
<p>Mo special but the screen a dead line</p>
<p>Every text sent, back in “No.” decline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The chorus booming again and up in tide</p>
<p>Augury before, now a lover asking why</p>
<p>I’d never met her; past by the halls, shy</p>
<p>Her blare out there, here but never eye</p>
<p>I could hear her now, in very faint chime</p>
<p>In my head, as a portcullis shielding kinds</p>
<p>Moving away, I had to find Robert, say hi.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Too beautiful to be lost in a stinky fight</p>
<p>A vernal night, and its call; ember ignite</p>
<p>Up from his side, with a wall cold like ice</p>
<p>Semblance from his memory stir a flight</p>
<p>I got away from that place, leaving for life</p>
<p>My room months ago, it was the turnpike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Felling warm, gay, wholesome, and a child</p>
<p>Leaving with grace a “No.” could not hide</p>
<p>By the bunk intimating to my ear: the light</p>
<p>As a boombox my iPhone blew in oh might</p>

            `<p>There is a mental crawl</p>
<p>Happening when it’s morn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wake crying in a drawl</p>
<p>As I do the Anon also hulls</p>
<p>Rapids of bogs for my thoughts</p>
<p>So I get swallowed right in bud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But today, there is a different bird</p>
<p>If it isn’t, the harmony of the song</p>
<p>Its deflection, hunch, and pompom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new poem in my scaling thoughts</p>
<p>In florescence I had gotten a call</p>
<p>A soft string pull, all in nature’s plot.</p><p> </p><img src="../../images/collections/iii/24 (Caged poems).jpg" class="img-fluid">`,
            `<p>I used to live in wait</p>
<p>Till everyone left, I’d stay</p>
<p>By my computer, pass the delay</p>
<p>I’d play games to remonstrate</p>
<p>Too long hours, even holidays.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d wait, till all was quiet-ached</p>
<p>The wind calling, in the only break.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my noggin, it drops in shedding weight</p>
<p>Robe from the shoulders of a magistrate</p>
<p>Magma flow acquiescing my nude taste.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I flung my clothes and took the day</p>
<p>Unclad thoughts, from reproach, shame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then I’d sing where the hollow crowns sane</p>
<p>Parroting echoes, hear myself all so very gay</p>
<p>Hit notes and fuss on the pitch being a may.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d leave my room, for the new house so plain</p>
<p>Enjoy my time alone before the bathing stage</p>
<p>Where the colours even now never came</p>
<p>Naked like I was, only it covered my blame.</p><p> </p><img src="../../images/collections/iii/25 (New house).jpg" class="img-fluid">`,

<p>A round of applause glistening</p>
<p>Thundering to make eyes gleam.</p>

<p>Nimble up the coop in a waking shin</p>
<p>Cops stormed the darkroom ring...</p>
<p>Before I knew, I was out the shindig.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Can’t ever tell, if it’s a whank, the queen</p>
<p>An unnoticed sudden screechy scream</p>
<p>Being awake makes all the questioning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Checked, my bladder sac holds no urine</p>
<p>There is movement, some stepping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You witness the door in its banging</p>

<p>He’s by the gate, I’m colt</p>

<p>On the first day he soaked</p>
<p>He knocked me out dead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He must be an accountant!</p>
<p>A moving class on the road?</p>
<p>He did say he is. Was, meant?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before the banks’ recap smoke</p>
<p>Twenty-five billion, news heard</p>
<p>The giants handed the mufflers</p>

<p>One fought; munched the debt!</p>
<p>On the chalk, board as a teacher</p>
<p>Business studies Monsieur mo</p>
<p>In the interim, till he’s at his best</p>
<p>Didn’t, so he fitted headteacher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After school, he would address</p>
<p>Pick our periods, make a mark</p>
<p>It wasn’t a bore, neither a bloat </p>
<p>It was fantastic, no air of dread.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And days he didn’t show hand</p>
<p>Since I thought of him as a mole</p>
<p>The headteacher his embarkment</p>

<p>An impressive farrago sundown</p>
<p>Birds flocked in detail copious</p>
<p>An anile doggerel on shoe </p>
<p>Wasted high on bourbon</p>
<p>Ambulating to Thursday</p>
<p>And it had on a bonnet</p>
<p>It matched my sleeve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On my table were left</p>
<p>Two seats</p>
<p>I expected just you</p>
<p>Sparkling water and ashtray.</p><p> </p><img src="../../images/collections/iii/28 (Mariam).jpg" class="img-fluid">`,

<p>The mad cock, cod-lord.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, there was a spell turn</p>
<p>It was on the b-ball court</p>
<p>A bawdy spot for meetups</p>
<p>The hub leading to the slurp</p>
<p>Where the dreams are long</p>
<p>And the mantras are too curt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were stories, bombs</p>
<p>Of escapades gone wrong</p>
<p>Dark promenades that hunt</p>
<p>Swiftly tossed off condoms</p>
<p>No jokes, you’d find nylons</p>
<p>It is the illusion hotel’s sock</p>
<p>It was the rep of the block</p>
<p>In classes, third year junior.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And management? For sure</p>
<p>For mornings, it’s whose call?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those rooms. I was bought</p>
<p>Quickie? Why not, come on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was here, and sure purse</p>
<p>For she just had to show up</p>
<p>A bit further ahead, in front</p>
<p>It was dark anyway, no spot</p>
<p>The light falling with my walk</p>
<p>The court and crowd, far-off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An angel is what you’re called</p>
<p>You are white attired in plum</p>
<p>Admired in the early months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was months in, a grey demon</p>
<p>Imbuing it in the night’s plot</p>
<p>Haha, dad never sees porn</p>
<p>If not, mine doesn’t disturb</p>
<p>So I download ‘em, and store</p>
<p>On his cool phone, a blind bore</p>
<p>Being in school ended my glut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You know boarding house sucks</p>
<p>Nothing changes to drive or spur</p>
<p>And one morning, all that is gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This female teacher is shocked</p>
<p>Caught with her panties. Stop!</p>
<p>I should have said so, no more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The red car dude and her battle?</p>
<p>Whoa! That’s it, why so, her voice</p>
<p>The science teacher who flogs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That one time, I was up in blush</p>
<p>Not spanks, but that lovely husk</p>
<p>It gets you rasp tight in a bond</p>
<p>I’m on, senseless mindful talk</p>
<p>In my head I went on and on</p>
<p>Like how the windows were shut</p>
<p>Ones to my mind. Mind her bum</p>
<p>Whom called to me, and implored</p>
<p>Nothing to lose, to get her spunk</p>
<p>Lash the big body men too butt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It went on, satisfying astricting smug</p>
<p>By sex, with her height, a lot ’d blur</p>
<p>Her patience, my conscience factor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And here, by my locker, dawn</p>
<p>The male teacher quarters’ hut</p>
<p>Panty in hand, she goes, pours</p>
<p>Good morn. Maybe so, burnt</p>
<p>It was too early, scenic error</p>
<p>She’d lost her pants, and what?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Someone had to inform, report</p>
<p>I poured it out, every suggestion</p>
<p>A lengthy prowl sent to the box</p>
<p>The suggestion box was small</p>
<p>But I had just joined the club</p>
<p>My first note was about faults.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I stood in wait, gentle in cloth</p>
<p>The night brought a wild draw</p>
<p>A feral grit instinct production</p>
<p>No one is ugly in the dark fog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was that she’d traced my flaws</p>
<p>I saw hers, head like a new figure</p>
<p>She smelled good, but too, dumb</p>
<p>It wasn’t erotic, it didn’t perturb</p>
<p>What did was what I had in funds</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough to smash, cum</p>
<p>The business on the dick by a stud</p>
<p>In the dark there, I couldn’t hump</p>
<p>Thoughts of a stolen book, more</p>
<p>All that money to stroke her bust</p>
<p>The classroom gave a mind fuck</p>
<p>Its resemblance to a library floor</p>
<p>The treasure floor always locked</p>
<p>Where I fapped once, awkward</p>
<p>I did, cos I had read well enough</p>
<p>Only another interest for a fop</p>
<p>So I let naked figures play fort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I paid her, but how? I cannot recall</p>
<p>Not mean, she let me some clomp</p>
<p>Pressing my business behind in gruff</p>
<p>All the time seeing her take my prong</p>
<p>Slowly spitting and sucking the knob.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I came, two was caught</p>
<p>Mind clarity and a sweet influx</p>
<p>Then her face, some tiny disgust</p>
<p>Oh the library, the now old stomp</p>
<p>She’d sent a latitat for my attention.</p><p> </p><img src="../../images/collections/iii/29 (Love letters and promenades).jpg" class="img-fluid">`,
            `<p>Ahmed took one too many pictures</p>
<p>Rummy for me, being male I thought</p>
<p>With my Adonis face cut in the crop</p>
<p>I’m bought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d go on, yapping ‘bout postures</p>
<p>Saying: how you’re reposed is sure</p>
<p>However you find yourself in gulf</p>
<p>Play ball.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Asking Moyo, he is no way at all a cross</p>
<p>Classmates and best friends, their bond</p>
<p>Six years together in high school’s jaw</p>
<p>I was a senior.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The days we’d no ties were a pleasure</p>
<p>Both athletes, so we met during sports</p>
<p>Sprint, beating me by a tiny gap to first</p>
<p>Oh his burst.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Often klatsch to smoke weed and talk</p>
<p>Skunk air, money moves, high fantods </p>
<p>He’d those by him, blacks with the pot</p>
<p>Not visitors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once, perched on a tree, he implored</p>
<p>In a sudden halt, of jeopardy, our turf</p>
<p>An eponym, the venue he’d demurred</p>
<p>He’d a mix-up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hellfire had bellowed at him a concuss</p>
<p>Compromised orphically, mind fraught</p>
<p>Quickly he douts his spliff in a full stop</p>
<p>Triggered taut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In hackling pule bye, he left the meetup</p>
<p>Harlem sunset, the man loved the buds</p>
<p>It was not the first time, but this struck;</p>
<p>That chord.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone wanted to leave town abroad</p>
<p>He discussed plans if he struck a windfall</p>
<p>With college degree foreign, not em duds</p>
<p>He’d warn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We had Hellfire, and also another Rooftop</p>
<p>Hellfire had a shrine, house made of mud</p>
<p>Rooftop, a home; hotel dream shutdown</p>
<p>By a despot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Evenings saw me over there on weed puff</p>
<p>Two spliffs, I’m buzzing with objecting buts</p>
<p>I left headachy, thoughts on what’s install</p>
<p>But I enjoyed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His Rooftop visits are points of sparse blurs</p>
<p>He introduced me to his friend, not the club</p>
<p>In the pictures taken, his lips held a gesture</p>
<p>As of more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once with lips sucked in so long, he spouts</p>
<p>If I would care to swap jeans, “It is grunge.”</p>
<p>“A black knee-ripped dungaree” in a surge</p>
<p>“Your court.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stuttering as I sometimes do, I stop, pause</p>
<p>No longer in memory now; by that I let up</p>
<p>He wanted what I had on, and for my notch</p>
<p>Something smut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stonewash and a naked knee from a big gut</p>
<p>Back having it, with a better upkeep purse</p>
<p>I’d go down on my left knee, say the words</p>
<p>Mariam, let’s have fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seeking fun is not everything; it is the call</p>
<p>Pleasure pairs with fun and it’s on the run</p>
<p>In the morning it’s coffee, at night it’s rum</p>
<p>A never humdrum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I smoked weed for years before the breakup</p>
<p>Twenty-one when I drew the first short puff</p>
<p>Twenty-five and I couldn’t go on, not till dust</p>
<p>Our divorce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But before then, pleasure took me on tour</p>
<p>Without Mariam, pals on the blame stub</p>
<p>To say I did, we visited a brothel slash pub</p>
<p>To end my grunts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First time having hashish, lain next to a boy</p>
<p>Wishes of it being a girl, for he dealt fudge</p>
<p>He’d done it, he transcended, saw a whore</p>
<p>A pivotal point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Final summer we left campus for a reunion</p>
<p>An old mate who’d left a fresher-abandon</p>
<p>He lost his closer friends then to expulsion</p>
<p>He dealt drugs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said he left because he got really bored</p>
<p>Few Messenger messages, we had to claw</p>
<p>We made plans to meet, it felt not so long</p>
<p>He decked the halls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joshua not long threw a fit, fit for a jock</p>
<p>Everything has been wrong from the jump</p>
<p>Even the car broke. Drawing my attention</p>
<p>Continuing in bug.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’d just concluded our finals, no touch ups</p>
<p>Freedom. End of university. End of lectures</p>
<p>And a wuss who’s known, laid whores, bucks?</p>
<p>He had my wits gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m hopeless romantic with the underworld</p>
<p>He gets up to leave, so I follow him on abut</p>
<p>He’s the one who’d done it; I play the bong</p>
<p>I needed to. I must.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just out. A thing amiss I could not tell at all</p>
<p>That my phone was missing, it had dropped</p>
<p>Bode handed it to me in good augur launch</p>
<p>The worker wasn’t buff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing changed in that town and I got a job</p>
<p>An initial hotel accommodation with hotspot</p>
<p>My office was nearby, I was on a row of luck</p>
<p>It was a pleasant adjust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My new town on the scale, was a good bump</p>
<p>A conducive estate, featuring relevant shops</p>
<p>Quiet mornings with a keen sense impetuous</p>
<p>For the doors!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new Apple Mac with mountains for desktop</p>
<p>One afternoon, my FaceTime got a cool buzz</p>
<p>It was unexpected in every way, a total prong</p>
<p>An employer usurp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Longer conversations later through the duct</p>
<p>Days after, I got money and very good cause</p>
<p>Spending more than the month’s earn sum</p>
<p>So I raised the crump.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most nights, we get a drop to the same spot</p>
<p>Light another one up, because it is that just</p>
<p>Pepsi Cola, great skunk, and live music pump</p>
<p>Pass the buck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Relaxed with friends and a colleague from work</p>
<p>Ideas we never heard flowed in slow prologue</p>
<p>Action figure said no to excitement and crutch</p>
<p>Fuck this crawl!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wasn’t a coward, he balled hard, a dawg</p>
<p>He’d sex whenever around, had no remorse</p>
<p>A field player since his first income catapult</p>
<p>No blotch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh I just couldn’t have the habit on staunch</p>
<p>He’d leave, my colleague was taking a drop</p>
<p>For his hotel, we for the ATM to get blunt</p>
<p>Following our plot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two luxury bedrooms to my name by dawn</p>
<p>A tart’s iPhone on the bed, how she forgot?</p>
<p>Out of the plot, a gang bang was her employ</p>
<p>I too felt lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another time, another place, for another shot</p>
<p>To reignite the plot, I had just received a wand</p>
<p>Action figure had been around, counting sluts</p>
<p>Leaving me the clot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Man, what do we do tonight? To me like a report</p>
<p>...we should hit the club. He suggests with force</p>
<p>No, I can't tolerate the music, smoke what I want.</p>
<p>I returned in a punch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s get a whore, stay at home, smoke rocks</p>
<p>It’ll be a gang bang, I’ll call up Chvrch my plug</p>
<p>We were at a bar, waiting for meals; in decision</p>
<p>Let’s hunt!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using a choice service we got through the worst</p>
<p>Met up with Chvrch for a gram of the stain blob</p>
<p>Headed back to my apartment, ready for the fluff</p>
<p>I was soon left in a lurch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Action figure in the bedroom treats women as gum</p>
<p>He chews them, pops them, and loves their engulf</p>
<p>He’s in the bedroom, I’m in the toilet, and I’m stuck</p>
<p>He’s the one focused.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An evening in my office, ring! My phone’s blurt</p>
<p>Thirteen seconds of his hand gripping a fat bum</p>
<p>Straight from the soda shop, with no blip of fuss</p>
<p>A straight boss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, I couldn’t leave, the girl brought in no joy</p>
<p>Her long eye lashes told me off like a soy boy</p>
<p>And when he came in, it wasn’t at all for rush</p>
<p>Here I was, PC Plod.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had burnt a tiny amount, alive, and in store</p>
<p>I am fine by this. A smile on his face as a duck</p>
<p>My headphones made love to me like a faggot</p>
<p>If I could see the bulge?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then he was done, and he was around for a burn</p>
<p>Meaning also, it was time I went for my own turn</p>
<p>A sort of gang bang? I sensed a no daring bunch</p>
<p>I’d stalled, for a flop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if facing the music, I branch out summoned</p>
<p>A nog to what is rising and push for a mugshot</p>
<p>He’d be there as I fucked her to watch me cum</p>
<p>That’s the stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With my pellet in, I in no time get a full stun</p>
<p>I didn’t get it, I had on rubber, a good condom</p>
<p>But it wasn’t real, definitely a thing was wrong</p>
<p>I was in top crumb.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was scared, I drew out, seeing her visage fond</p>
<p>A second scare, it was dark and I couldn’t trust</p>
<p>Maybe I fucked her, maybe I didn’t, can’t recall</p>
<p>It’s a blank cloche.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pleasure chase is everything; it isn’t always yum</p>
<p>The hedonist serves the animal and it, his word</p>
<p>Action figure told me all about his favourite toy</p>
<p>An app you don’t grub.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who will be the incel in society? Him why not.</p>
<p>They need someone, but I found you; that’s love</p>
<p>Like an ad, walking me through his chatting hub</p>
<p>In measure, a tailor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I got a girl, had her once, a time for a second</p>
<p>She loved it, it seemed, she called, I blocked</p>
<p>A jolly session, I pondered my condom off</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh her buns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I no longer own those old rip jeans anymore</p>
<p>But I could buy one, better, get a franchisor</p>

            `<p>For how long have I had to wear a cap?</p>
<p>Twenty-four.</p>
<p>If that’s a year for every hour of the day</p>
<p>A do-rag?</p>
<p>It’s okay to say I sleep with my cap donned.</p>
<p>I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover</p>
<p>No beautiful long locks like Samson</p>
<p>So you don’t spot my strength.</p>
<p>Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini</p>
<p>So you don’t pick out my valour.</p>
<p>Scars and bars, a tale starting age six.</p>
<p>I hide scars though detained within bars</p>
<p>Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell</p>
<p>A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think when I am older...</p>
<p>“Older” seems like a hold on the change I await</p>
<p>The ums in circle of my own social weight</p>
<p>The moral of my own morale.</p>
<p>Starting from just us two</p>
<p>A ball, a light fixture, a veranda</p>
<p>I’m six, she’s three years old</p>
<p>The ball isn’t ours, it is lost</p>
<p>Over the fence it came like a gift.</p>
<p>Back from school days after</p>
<p>I am alone and up in the air above me</p>
<p>It hits a glass light-fixture.</p>
<p>Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock</p>
<p>White shirt fused in red gush of blood</p>
<p>Soaking... soon I am back to.</p>
<p>At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong.</p>
<p>I have a picture at seven</p>
<p>I have an oversized watch</p>
<p>And a scar</p>
<p>No cap.</p>
<p>It asks when I’ll go without a cap</p>
<p>Give back the oversized watch to the photographer.</p>
<p>The one who is three thinks she did it</p>
<p>Cos I lied.</p>
<p>“You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.”</p>
<p>“And it came down.”</p>
<p>The real fall comes from who broke the thing.</p>
<p>For us.</p>
<p>She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best</p>
<p>“I lied back then.”</p>
<p>How best do I know with my cap on now?</p>
<p>I’ll be thirty soon.</p>
<p>When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat</p>
<p>I tried a new haircut and a friend told me</p>
<p>“Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.”</p>
<p>What has changed?</p>
<p>I convince myself it’s the nutrients</p>
<p>But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars.</p>
<p>The holding back; to a time I dream of</p>
<p>A time like the past I won’t remember</p>
<p>Six could be wrong, three could be right</p>
<p>If I don’t do something.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I recorded a public video with no cap</p>
<p>And now I know all the help I can get.</p>
<p>To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.</p><p> </p><img src="../../images/collections/iii/37 (Twenty-four).jpg" class="img-fluid">`,
