    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         It’s funny, discovering how much of common literature I have no knowledge of. I am amazed at the staggering intrinsic woven in these stories . . . Shakespeare. Having read brave new world — well just a summary; yet to complete the text. Discovering how much of these stories have similar inclines to real word happenings is astonishing, I can only but be content with the gradual uncovering of these great works.</p>

I will be starting a course by Sam Harris; it’s called <i> Waking up with Sam Harris. </i> I can’t wait to start.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Starting the program, really interesting, I discovered a technique of meditation, twice now. First, in a book by Yuval Noah Harari; 21 lessons of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and now, in the course by Sam Harris, it’s called <strong><i> Vipassana</i> </strong>, it’s translated as <strong><i> insight</i> </strong><i> , </i> gotten from the Buddhism school of <strong><i> Theravada</i> </strong>. The Theravada is said to be the oldest tradition of Buddhism, and the quality of mind to be cultivated, attained, is mindfulness.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I had a dream, we were kids, got married under a mango tree, kissed and turned to fairies. I had an idea come to me, I’ll put my joy in breaking things, the climax of this, being my bachelor night; breaking plates, cups, all that gives a smash sound, till it pops a joint or lose interest out of sheer fatigue.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         In an age, where all everyone cares about, is narcissism, hence the reason I’m interested in my story. Heather Mac Donald has won my heart, the part that’s mad at close female acquaintances, who’ve chosen to bank their existence on entitlements. I’ll refute all sexist claims, each has been given a cross to bear.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">Night Visions</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Can’t remember much, all I can is, I was in a hotel room, I presume, from memories of familiar spaces, a room with a transparent backdrop of glass wall.

I’ll be giving it a second listen. From the poem of today by Eleanor Farjeon, I learned that poems are for memorizing as well as for memorializing. Makes me ponder what I’ll be memorizing and memorializing in any poem I’ll be writing soon, probably of the love of years past?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Listening in on the audiobook by Grant Cardone, “Be obsessed or be average”. I’m reminded on the lesson from months back, there is something, to refreshing your mind, just as the bible says, the constant washing of the feet; the symbolism for reminding yourself. There is also something, to reading your own words, as said by Jordan B Peterson in a discourse with him, and Heather Mac Donald, on what the higher in higher education means.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Coming in to this house, my father’s property, one where I spent a lot of years growing up, it’s suddenly reminded me, of how important mental health is, and how easy it is to lose the band. It’s sad, seeing people, full blown sick, being dangerous, not to themselves alone, but to their immediate environment, and people in it.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The washing of the feet is a wake-up call, haters will be haters. They are the fuel I need for my next level; Jesse Elder says haters aren’t to be given any attention, and you don’t need them. He has an approach to handling them, mine being the aphorism from today’s devotional, “You Don’t Have to Have an Opinion”. The only problem: handling naysayers, the one’s closest, people with the highest affinity at afflicting damage.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

It’s 5:58 AM.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I’m starting a course on scepticism today, same day, my dad tells me I’ll be visiting a witch doctor. Apparently, my life has being going, not so impressive, as he’d like it to go. I’ll be having a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards it. A week from now I guess I’ll be in this man’s presence. What are the thoughts I’ll be entertaining, and what suggestions would the surrounding enclave of mystic shenanigans offer? Maybe bones of dead sapiens, I bet they can’t summon the balls to entertain their guest with such bizarreness. Anyway it goes I’ll be having a good one, it’s not my first time being tricked to believe in some mystic phenomenon. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>I will be starting my day now, just saw the first episode of Rugrats, haven’t seen it all, going great, will probably see it again, I was munching away while watching so I was kind of divided between my sweet tooth and my cliché childhood nostalgic flight. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 12:01 AM and I’m listening to <i> My Birthday by Anne Marie</i> , great song, started the lecture on The Bhagavid Gita, no it should be Bhagavad Gita, yes I got it after looking it up. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 3:32 PM, sipping from the perennial knowledge fountain of the great ones, I found a great nugget I’d like to deposit here.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">Lesson Bits</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from today’s poem, quote <i> “It’s modern warfare’s answer to an ancient wisdom trialed and true, when fighting wars, you first destroy all songs of innocence and joy.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Acting from Karma-Yoga; not getting attached to the fruits. According to the Bhagavad Vita, your action becomes more effective. Krishna says: “thinking<i>  of objects, attachment is formed in the mind, from attachment, longing, and from longing anger grows. From anger, comes delusion, and from delusion, loss of memory, and from loss of memory, comes the ruin of understanding, from the ruin of understanding, man perishes</i> .” But if you can act in accordance with Karma-Yoga, you’ll be at peace.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> “But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with senses under restraint, free from attraction and aversion, attains the tranquility.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Krishna says <i> “He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after happiness, who is become free from affection, fear, and wrath is indeed the sage of steady wisdom.”</i>  What a lovely image to be the sage of steady wisdom, calm, unperturbed, regardless of what might come.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

People with feasible tyrant traits like the immediate younger offspring, after my conception; delineating between alive and dead, living taking precedence, is a specimen for objective prodding. Understanding why siblings raised under the same living conditions, stray from the path of rationality to a cul-de-sac of mentally agitated existence, sprouting a decadence of personal, ethical harmony in nuclear relationships, and communal engagements.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Living is for the purposeful, to be purposeful is to seek change. To seek change is to have a nucleus of permanence, for change only comes as a morph, not as a replacement.

Such irony! A perfect inverse misnomer on what’s happened, well; from the name of the song, the song itself being perfidious, at least in relation to the course of my initial posit narrative. I planned on keeping this pithy, but for some hypothetical telepathic phenomenon, I’m yet to laser on; sceptical about this, I will bow to no pseudo-science, I’m here ranting on about thoughts of little significance. Well, what I wanted to pen down is, it’s a beautiful time to be alive. Why? You may ask. Well, tens of centuries ago, my community of tribal bigots will have their ease on the edge, by the constant fear of raiders in thirst of victims’ blood. Maybe the times aren’t so provident, with constant flares of provocation, the one under the lens, being the anticlimax; my neighbour has chosen to live a life that encompasses not just her thoughts, but that of a foreign being, or maybe this computer is hacked like my previous, whichever way it goes, I’ll be in the heart of tranquillity, putting subliminal and outcries of raucous babel where they belong, in the thrash where nulled thoughts go.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Social interaction involves reconciling different aspects of the personality, the <i> epistemic</i>  understanding of the personality being gestalt, I need to find ways of holistic living, preserving the authenticity of character, giving room to proper positioning in ways that allow easy switching of polar activities without a need to induce zeal through the stimulation of the senses.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I need to understand that I have done nothing wrong by improving on myself, I am doing myself a great service by forging on and implementing the best form of technology that builds my mind, and ensures an utmost throughput. Understanding, that my environment is different from the inside world of tranquil, positioning my attention at the laser motion of important impressions, believing that situations are nothing but what they are; external forces with simple blunt invitations that can’t perturb or seize my attention if I don’t break the bond of personal purpose and veneration. Implementing the safe measure of pushing out any self that hopes to validate already concluded, reviewed substrates of understanding and loci flames of purpose, avoiding alluring applications of mitigation with aim of disturbing my rest.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Today is a day of love, but right now I feel hate, its 12:55 PM. Hate is an emotion that stirs out of envy, the envy I feel is the fact that you wielded the power to hurt me. In time I will put a cross around you, a symbol of the hate I feel for you, to stir and feel when you find someone you love. <i> Anonymous neighbor</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I was hoping to write haiku poems, but I changed my mind, I’ll rather express the pleasures of my heart, how you make me feel; your love, will you still love me if ever I’m not just yours? Will you be mine if I ever seem screwy? Will you understand the love behind my past mistakes? Will you love my <i> consumed</i> ; my heart? My mistakes? Dear Lulu.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         If pernicious subtle uttered wicked thoughts and acted actions, directed at no one but self; camouflaged from the immediate conscious impression of perception; disguised from the awareness of, intended by inherent intentions of deceiving whom the aimed perceiver is, eventually get to one, know this is a beam at shadows of the loopholes of the mind caught. If living becomes a rationale at understanding objectively what this reality is, with paranoia being an allusion to the impossible nature of a man who seeks to understand the inchoate words of a mob. When this happens, know there has been a distraction of willed attention, leading to paralysis of directional intention, since perception has been seized; focus hijacked. The solution is to ask - what is the ideal idiosyncratic position of purpose at the current time? </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 10:35 PM, and I’m yet to write the poems, I’ll get dinner now and get to it.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">To-do</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Implementing the safe measure of pushing out all self that hopes to validate already concluded, reviewed, substrates of understanding and loci flames of purpose.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>EDIT </strong> (12/03/2020 11:33A.M):</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Process of achieving this has begun, with the introduction of the indifferent spectator, I call her BusiSkrit.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

On calling the agent, he informs us on how, he’s heard the news and the only reason the visa will be refused is if the request is for immigration, which mine isn’t. That has been taken care of.

The ongoing intimidation was concocted after the keen observation of the subject in natural states of affair, learning the routinised way of affairs, deciding what elates and irritates, on concluding by coming to an awareness of these simple things, an epithet was introduced: <i> the game mind</i> , dangled as a new way of living, I choose not to elucidate this as I have in the past, the only addition is my new conceptualized understanding of this epithet, an analogy; compared to a game bird, an animal hunted for sport.

I know the color perfectly and completely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it is even theoretically possible. Thus the sense data which make up the appearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, and things immediately known to me, just as they are.” </i> What Russell seems to overlook here is that this basic knowledge to which no knowledge can be theoretically added is a place where we uncover an intrinsic limit to understanding. Consider any facet of experience, in this case a vision of color; stirring the tide of thoughts long enough to merely observe it as it is, the fact of being in total ignorance of what it is can become obvious. </p>\n\n    <p>         What is the color blue? Not as a function of wavelengths of light or neurophysiology, but at it is directly perceived. We’re really left with nothing to say but that it’s blue, which does nothing to clarify things, in fact it’s not even blue, which is just a word; it’s a noise we’re making. What we see before us is whatever it ineffably is. Focusing on this distance between concepts and experience is a means of sneaking up on a truth that is generally described in Buddhism, as the <i> The truth of emptiness</i> : the idea that no thing has intrinsic independent existence in the way that it seems. The moment we suspend the conceptual associations we have with a given object, or perception; our knowledge about it, our direct experience of it can gray into this experience of pure mystery. We’re left with this wordless intuition of consciousness and its content.</p>\n\n    <p>         Meditation isn’t about understanding things conceptually, it’s the ability to experience things more clearly, prior to concepts, it’s the knowledge by acquaintance taking to the highest degree, leading to another state of being: a new form of intelligence, a psychological freedom that a continuous entanglement with concept doesn’t. </p>\n\n    <p>         A famous parable from the Buddha meant to get at this difference - A man is struck in the chest by a poison arrow, and a surgeon rushes to his side to begin the work of saving his life, bu the man resist, he wants to know the name of the fletcher who fashioned the arrows shaft, and the type of wood from which it was cut, and the mode of the man who shot it, and the name of the horse upon which he rode, and a thousand other things that have no bearing at all upon his present suffering or his ultimate survival, so this man needs to get his priority straight, his commitment to thinking about <i> world</i>  results from a basic misunderstanding of his predicament. We too have more problems that will not be solved by more thinking.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

He is later unmoored after successive fallibility. Drawing from my own memories, while on the mandatory internship program in my third year in the university, at computer village, Ikeja. Caught up on a rainy day, outside the office, seeking refuge at a gas station with a colleague, waiting for the rain to subside, a scrawny, untidy man in dirty white coloured robes, a bible under his arm, hobbles past us where we sat knee close to chest, in a traipse manner, he seemed to be begging for alms; more like a mendicant.

Because old experience wane hard.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from today’s reading of a short story by Octavia Butler: Speech Sounds: “<i> His use of the left hand interested Rye more than his obvious question. Left-handed people tended to be less impaired, more reasonable and comprehending, less driven by frustration, confusion, and anger.</i> ” Now I don’t know how true this is, but it’s an interesting statement.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Another excerpt from Octavia Butler’s short story collection titled <strong>The Evening and the Morning and the Night</strong>. <i> “The weird part was, I worked hard, got top grades. If you work </i> <strong><i> hard</i> </strong><i>  enough at something that </i> <strong><i> doesn’t matter</i> </strong><i> , you can </i> <strong><i> forget</i> </strong><i>  for a while about the things that do.” </i> Now drawing from the incident I was just involved in. Helping my mom with her tea, filling up her flask, random activities of little to no significance, my dad calls me, informing me I’ll need to have the waste made available for the trash collector on his arrival. Dropping the flask in my mom’s room, I move forward to helping with the trash, but first, do I have soap to wash after this dirty activity? No! Is it really important, taking the trash out, when he can just come in to get it? Well, his wife says she doesn’t want the trash collector in the compound, another dictum from the madam, at whose peril actually? His? Mine? Why? I’m not so sure. Just another impudence at the individuals in the household who actually do the work. Mind made up. I don’t plan on taking any trash out, if he needs the trash out, he either plays on whomsoever’s logic is needed to have the trash collector come in, or let his <i> slave-boy</i>  - me - as I’ve always been, handle it. But no, he won’t. On returning back to the building, after waiting several minutes, intending to ascertain if he, the trash man still is on his way, I meet with Father, telling me I have to take it out, the following conversation ensued, I paraphrase. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: Where is the man?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: His cart is full. He has gone to empty it; he says he’ll be coming back soon.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: Have you taken the trash out?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: Why?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: I’d rather have him come in to get it.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: He can’t come in.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: I have no soap to wash after.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Father gives a scornful remark, imposing his will on mine, I leave his presence, informing him of my defiance as a result of his disdain of my wants. I remember growing up, my dad telling my mom, how he doesn’t know me, he doesn’t know who I am? Think of it. If he doesn’t know who I was, how can he know me; who I currently am? A reference to the letter sent to him should be inferred for proper a priori discerning.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The reason I relate all these is to draw and infer, showing how easy it is to lose all sense of self, if I had listened to his advice - father - of not reading. I’d be an animal wielded by the raucous of nonchalant individuals with imposing bigoted views, losing sense of the loci flame that has stirred me so far, instead of chasing the wind.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I switched programs, for the windows media player, with intentions to listen to <i> Wolf Bite</i>  only to have <i> The Real World</i>  by <i> Owl City</i>  played, I was swept away, mood changed, and now I feel lighter; my capricious ass. During the playback, a thought swept through my mind, it was in concession with some lines from the song, how he’d rather live in an imaginary world than live in the real world. I indulge in this by reading books myself, fiction, or non-fiction, any goes, as long as it offers a true episode of escapism, the perfect reverie.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Reading the fable, <i> the house of ELD.</i>  I’m taken to the aisle of memory; in view: on the counter. My high-school graduation year book parting words. I paraphrase: “The lord has given us a course to chart during this lifetime, but not without the opportunity to plot ours”. As few as these words are, they signalled the imminent actions, shaped by fore-thoughts, that’d determine the story of my life. So insinuating were the words to my uncle; the proprietor, he avoided speaking to me directly about it, instead meets with my dad admonishing him.

The process of abstraction, and of concept-formation is a process of </i> <strong><i> reason</i> </strong><i> , of thought; it is not automatic nor instinctive nor involuntary nor infallible. Man has to initiate it, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level of consciousness is nonvolitional; volition begins with the first </i> <strong><i> syllogism</i> </strong><i> . Man has the choice to think or to evade—to maintain a state of full awareness or to drift from moment to moment, in a semi-conscious daze, at the mercy of whatever associational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> But the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness need to exercise it in order to survive. An animal’s consciousness functions automatically; an animal perceives what it is able to perceive and survives accordingly, no further than the perceptual level permits and no better. Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic guidance, they </i> <strong><i> do not</i> </strong><i>  give him the knowledge he needs, </i> <strong><i> only the material of knowledge</i> </strong><i> , which his mind has to integrate. Man is the </i> <strong><i> only</i> </strong><i>  living species who has to perceive reality—which means: to be conscious—by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily </i> <strong><i> epistemological</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by </i> <strong><i> adjusting his background to himself</i> </strong><i> . If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacks them animals perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States. But one </i> <strong><i> does not</i> </strong><i>  obtain food, safety or freedom—by instinct..”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> “Those who could become the New Intellectuals are America’s hidden assets; their number is probably greater than anyone can estimate; they exist in every profession, even among the present intellectuals. But they are scattered in silent helplessness throughout the country, or hidden in that underground which, in human history, has too often swallowed the best of men’s potential: </i> <strong><i> subjectivity</i> </strong><i> . They are the men who have long since lost respect for the cultural standards to which they conform, but who hide their own convictions or repress their ideas or suppress their minds, each feeling that he has no chance against the others, each serving as both victim and destroyer. The New Intellectuals will be those men who will come out into the open and have the courage to break that vicious circle.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> If they glance at the state of our culture, they will see that the entire miserable show is kept up by nothing but </i> <strong><i> routine</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> pretence</i> </strong><i> , which disguise bewilderment and fear: nobody dares to take the first new step, everybody waits for his neighbour’s initiative. If a society reaches the stage where every man accepts the feeling that he is “a stranger and afraid in a world [he] never made,” the world it gives up will be made by Attila. The greatest need today is for men who are </i> <strong><i> not strangers to reality</i> </strong><i> , because they are not afraid of thought. The New Intellectuals will be those who will take the initiative and the responsibility: they will check their own philosophical premises, identify their convictions, integrate their ideas into coherence and consistency, then offer to the country a view of existence to which the wise and honest can repair.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of his </i> <strong><i> title</i> </strong><i> : a man who is guided by his intellect—not a zombie guided by feelings, instincts, urges, wishes, whims or revelations. Ending the rule of Attila and the Witch Doctor, he will discard the basic premise that made them possible: the soul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts and contradictions, such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, reality versus desire, the practical versus the moral. He will be an integrated man, that is: a thinker who is a man of action. He will know that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas is suicidal. He will know that the conceptual level of </i> <strong><i> psycho-epistemology</i> </strong><i> —the volitional level of reason and thought—is the </i> <strong><i> basic necessity</i> </strong><i>  of man’s survival and his greatest </i> <strong><i> moral virtue</i> </strong><i> . He will know that men need philosophy for the purpose of living on earth.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The New Intellectual will be a reunion of the twins who should never have been separated: the intellectual and the businessman. He can come from among the best—that is: the most rational—men who may still exist in both camps. In place of an involuntary Witch Doctor and a reluctant Attila, the reunion will produce two new types: the </i> <strong><i> practical thinker</i> </strong><i>  and the </i> <strong><i> philosophical businessman</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The best among the present intellectuals should consider the tremendous power which they are holding, but have never fully exercised or understood. If any man among them feels that he is the helpless, ineffectual step-son of a “materialistic” culture that grants him neither wealth nor recognition, let him remember the meaning of his title: his power is his intellect, not his feelings, emotions, or intuitions. It is not the businessmen who have robbed him of efficacy, but those of his colleagues who have degraded his profession to the level of soothsayers, tea-leaf readers, and jungle oracles. Let him break with the neo-mystics; let him realize that ideas are not an escape from reality, not a hobby for “disinterested” neurotics in ivory towers, but the most </i> <strong><i> crucial</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> practical </i> </strong><i> power in human existence. Then let him become an intellectual leader who assumes full responsibility for the practical consequences of his theories.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Sacrilegious is the holistic make up of the pretender who claims to teach.

One ironic assumption along these lines: that having a lot of money makes you wealthy. Or that because a lot of people believe something, it must be true. </i> I should be reminded of how over the past few months I’ve been attacked throughout the clock, pushing me to a wall of annihilation, annihilation of not just life, this being the last in the gradient of the destructive process set in motion. I have lost proper expression of my cognitive processes, my thoughts hampered by the constant brainwashing, and inducing of hypnotic states that produce awareness of a <i> self;</i>  suggested, as not worked on by self, the constant deliberate mass action of hindering any form of progress as an individual, of the individual.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I have become chafe from having to wait for the visa appointment, it’s been months now, waiting for the online portal registration, amidst all the lies, I have chosen to keep aloof, in the event of things not working out fine, I have plans.

Examining the expressions of beings shouldn’t be taken outside of the domain of thought origin, impulse and backgrounds like profession, family. This being a subculture diagnosis.

I am asking myself whether Soma could have possessed the power to spark what I have called these triune traits.</i> ” it’s a surmise not a factual theory.

E. Housman</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">Entries</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Here is a profound insight, two points of view. One from a school of thought, a way of living — Stoicism. And an evolutionary perspective of instinctive response integrated with mythological discernment. The latter from a lecture on the biblical series: <i> Introduction to the idea of God</i>  by Professor Jordan B Peterson, the former from today’s stoic devotional. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Nature is beautiful. intelligence; beauty with direction. The latter suggest the use of attention and language to confront things that most threaten us. “<i> If there are things that upset — chaotic, terrible, serpentine, monstrous underworld things that threaten — the best thing is to open your eyes, get your speech organized, and go out and confront the thing, and make the world out of it — cancel out the upsetting object</i> .” My understanding of this view is the instinctive discernment of the archetypal problem using perceptual inference. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The other suggest, I paraphrase: “<i> When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you don’t then make a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspicion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him, not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance. You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a pass to many things with our fellow trainees. For, as I’ve said, it’s possible to avoid without suspicion or hate.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> By seeing each day and each situation as a kind of training exercise, the stakes suddenly become a lot lower. The way you interpret your own mistakes and the mistakes of others is suddenly a lot more generous. It’s certainly a more resilient attitude than going around acting like the stakes of every encounter put the championship on the line.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> When you catch an elbow or an unfair blow today, shake off the pain and remind yourself: I’m learning. My sparring partner is learning too. This is practice for both of us—that’s all. I know a bit more about him or her, and from my reaction, they’re going to learn a little bit more about me too.</i> ”</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         These two perspectives enjoin us on modes of reaction, a dichotomy of perception and action. I seem to be not just a practicing stoic but a budding philosopher.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Some quotes I found on a look-up of the name <strong>Vladimir Nabokov a </strong>Russian and American novelist, poet, translator, and entomologist:</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The breaking of a wave cannot explain the whole sea.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Some quotes from <strong>Jacques Lacan</strong></p>\n\n    <p><i> What does it matter how many lovers you have if none of them gives you the universe?</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The knowledge that there is a part of the psychic functions that are out of conscious reach, we did not need to wait for Freud to know this!</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> In other words, the man who is born into existence deals first with language; this is a given. He is even caught in it before his birth.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

In potentially negative situations, the objective, even superficial gaze might actually be superior. That view might let us see things clearly without diving too much into what they might represent or what might have caused them. In other situations, particularly those that involve something impressive or praiseworthy, another approach, like that of contemptuous expressions, is helpful. By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.</i> </p>\n\n    <p>           <i> Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find?

I quote from Why Beauty Matters by Roger Scruton “<i> … why beauty matters. It is not just a subjective thing but a universal need of human beings. If we ignore this we find ourselves in a spiritual desert.</i> ” A reflection from my days of ingesting weed, I remember the epiphany from thought stirring, the revelation of abstainment.

On a motorcycle, three minutes, maybe. And now, we were close to the roundabout. We weren’t on the wrong side of the road, there is a ditch to the left, and by the right, is the other lane leading back to the trap house. Nothing was out of place, but slowly, the ground clambered, as if, it too had developed legs of its own. Strangely we all continued as if defying gravity. It was so cool, as I could see the big ditch, with those weird eyes that see the whole dream as a whole. I just went on like the others, I felt like Superman, as if aware and knowing of something more.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Dreams are like stories from a bunch of random cut out stencils.

But an allusion to its nature can be a fond conclusion for the uninitiated—the untrained mind. The psychoanalytic methodology of dream interpretation is sacrosanct in understanding events, or more broadly: the articulated sphere of being. I skimmed a book in the arts, and to that, it suggested dreams mean nothing; madness you will find there. In point, the event of this morning—my inability to restrain myself—leading to a little outburst, a result of my emotional frustration at the constant discord reactions; a misjudgement of the constant frivolities, including chores. My opinionated ideas on the importance of a family’s need for an ideal that supports a conduct that reflects success is paramount. It’s important the individual doesn’t lose sense of his identity. A dream says a lot and I had one—a reminder, to never walk naked.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I used to wonder how men could say it, know it, yet give it up—until I observed more closely the men of my own and the preceding generations. They had given it up and, along with it, they had given up everything that makes life worth living: conviction, purpose, values, future. They were drained, embittered hulks whimpering occasionally about the hopelessness of life. Whatever spiritual treason they had committed, they could not accept the cultural sewer of the present, they could not forget that they had once seen a higher, nobler possibility. Unable or unwilling to grasp what had destroyed it, they kept cursing the world, or kept calling men to return to meaningless dogmas, such as religion and tradition, or kept silent. Unable to stifle their vision or to fight for it, they took the “easy” way out: they renounced valuing.

Remembering—not recording in the journal—the epithet from the concluded topic on the psycho-epistemology of art, it ends on the note of <i> the sense of life</i> , citing primitive forms of philosophy like religion, its many myths, and allegories on man’s existence, like the myth of a supernatural recorder from whom nothing can be hidden, who lists all of a man’s deeds. It affirms the principle of staying grounded—not out of kilter—to one’s moral. Back in Dubai my moral volition hit crossroads, almost closing in on a debacle. I think the 33 stands for a transcendence. I can say now I stand in a better place.

When I say “deal with” I mean retranslate all the abstractions into the perceptual concretes for which they stand—i.e., reconnect them to reality—and hold it all in the focus of one’s conscious awareness. There is no way to integrate such a sum without projecting an actual human figure—an integrated concretization that illuminates the theory and makes it intelligible. </i> Another quote: <i> Moral principles remain in their minds as floating abstractions, offering them a goal they cannot grasp and demanding that they reshape their souls in its image, thus leaving them with a burden of undefinable moral guilt. Art is the indispensable medium for the communication of a moral ideal. </i> Jesus is a beautiful attempt at well-crafted art. A model for Christians. <i> Without the assistance of art, ethics remains in the position of theoretical engineering: art is the model-builder.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

My choice to spend time with a friend on his birthday led him, and not just his league of pals, but also a girl I’d held dear for a while, to sift through my actions for reckless volitions. An attack on what is most dear—my identity. The repudiation of a need for consciousness in wakefulness; the allure of blackout through an impersonation of my recent character, reiterated to me in conscious awakening. A foolproof frame-up to suggest of excesses ungrounded. Here goes another set of quotes from the Romantic Manifesto on Art: <i> One of the distinguishing characteristics of a work of art (including literature) is that it serves no practical, material end, but is an end in itself; it serves no purpose other than contemplation—and the pleasure of that contemplation is so intense, so deeply personal that a man experiences it as a self-sufficient, self-justifying primary and, often, resists or resents any suggestion to analyse it: the suggestion, to him, has the quality of an attack on his identity, on his deepest, essential self.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> No human emotion can be causeless, nor can so intense an emotion be causeless, irreducible, and unrelated to the source of emotions (and of values): to the needs of a living entity’s survival. Art does have a purpose and does serve a human need; only it is not a material need, but a need of man’s consciousness. Art is inextricably tied to man’s survival—not to his physical survival, but to that on which his physical survival depends: to the preservation and survival of his consciousness.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Note all these in light of my art. The attack on the validity of my artistic expression—denial of the efficacy of my consciousness; the negation of my fundamental understanding of reality—as a prelude to that which is essential—my consciousness. The defaming statement: <i> you said, consciousness isn’t important </i> is a direct inciting, a proposing of minimal intelligence—this being a form of the sub-animal, the instinctive, a semi-conscious wielding of a half-arsed brain wasted away, failed on abstinence; repetitive drug use—being smug okay in guiding and volitive excogitation.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I should remember the need; and utmost—to know of the things important, the things that matter most—is non-social. To remain conscious of this is important, as the inherent mode of intelligence in itself is insular, constantly regressing and gaining obsoleteness in ever growing complexity. The constant abstraction and assimilation of newly understood concepts is to redefine perceptual inference, the intuitive, and is to reprogram the subconscious. Intelligence in humans without conscious wielding is instinctive—impulse driven, a process, a form of distortion—and not learning, not progressive, it’s to return to the primitive, to leave evolution to the natural selection—a task of billion years. It doesn’t improvise.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Altruism the cancer of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the cancerous outgrowth in communities; the birth child of culture. <i> One of the grimmest monuments to altruism is man’s culturally induced selflessness: his willingness to live with himself as with the unknown, to ignore, evade, repress the personal (the non-social) needs of his soul, to know least about the things that matter most, and thus to consign his deepest values to the impotent underground of subjectivity and his life to the dreary wasteland of chronic guilt. </i> One of the lethal contamination of the arts is the gradual pernicious encroachment; the spread of false ideals: culturally induced selflessness, the enjoyment of intelligible aesthetics, the failure to fight; to think. If art is the model-builder, what models are being churned out by modern culture? If this is true: <i> The basic purpose of art is not to teach, but to show—to hold up to man a concretized image of his nature and his place in the universe. </i> What image is being represented.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         How about a game of speak and kill, a peek a boo, Sermo Liber Vita Ipsa.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"
