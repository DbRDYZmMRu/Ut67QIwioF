Muse

Cheers with the juice

That’s her goose

Loving you . .

Don’t me make me lose my proof

Inebriating

Her drizz’ is alluring

In every tick

Here where the itch is adorn

Pre sale

Detail

Duck ignoring

Wit tail

Now i’m mumbling

I’m down

Down

Oh my love

I’m down

Down

[bridge]

Would you ping back?

Oh darling!

Would you ping back?

Oh darling!

Dunе

Tune on tune

Ebb, wave my mood

Frolic trombone

Play her on

On

Female looking good

I’m up

Sun, sun

My yawn

Luge through

Crook tooth

Tomb

Spew boom

Spew boom
