i [intro]

come on!

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

fishing out

busy out

i’m not coming home tonight

wanna have some fun with some pretty girls

out here is where i wanna die girl


[chorus]

you calling me home

and i can’t say no

i just wanna take a long way home

for the love

for the love

taking the long way home

for the love

for the love


[verse 2]

i give myself away tonight

for you, and you, that pretty blonde too

she got a ass

that make me wanna jump

i scored too

not just on assistance

[chorus]

you calling me home

and i can’t say no

i just wanna take a long way home

for the love

for the lovе

taking the long way home

for the lovе

for the love
