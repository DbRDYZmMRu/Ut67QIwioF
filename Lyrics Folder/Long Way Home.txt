I [intro]

Come on!

Fresh boy chilling

[verse 1]

Fishing out

Busy out

I’m not coming home tonight

Wanna have some fun with some pretty girls

Out here is where i wanna die girl

[chorus]

You calling me home

And i can’t say no

I just wanna take a long way home

For the love

For the love

Taking the long way home

For the love

For the love

[verse 2]

I give myself away tonight

For you, and you, that pretty blonde too

She got a ass

That make me wanna jump

I scored too

Not just on assistance

[chorus]

You calling me home

And i can’t say no

I just wanna take a long way home

For the love

For the lovе

Taking the long way home

For the lovе

For the love
