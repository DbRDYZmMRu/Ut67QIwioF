[chorus]

d+mn, i feel, emma i feel

everything grows

and you wanting me, bond

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same

[verse 1]

in my heart

is where your lil love is

in my heart is where i feel it

being the same

(being the same)

nothing ever moves

nothing ever quells it

holly, your ever dude is

dampen destroy, distraught

have a look into, he is there, hе is in

destroy his track

oh you’ve been the only oasis


[chorus]

d+mn, i feel, emma i feel

evеrything grows

and you wanting me, bond

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same

d+mn, i feel, d+mn, i feel

everything goes

and nothing is the same
