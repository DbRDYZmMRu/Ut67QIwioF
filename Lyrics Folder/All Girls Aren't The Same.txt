[intro]

mind is on the road

i’m not losing sight of where i’m from

my utters’ din is not wearing in form

i see you clear


[chorus]

flaying this

afraid of this

what to do to equate this

querying another question

nothing off these pages

flaying this

afraid of this

what to do to equate this

querying another question

nothing off these pages

i’ll shrive on, now i’m enough

ignoring the devil

i’ll shrive on, now i’m enough

leviathan


[bridge]

for a minute

d+mn minute

i mean it

some minutes

why you tune for a minute

4chan

i mean it

dreaming low sale

now you gotta be the one

now i gotta be the man

jimmy for her love

now you gotta be the woman

my girl, be the woman

[verse 1]

eye on the cash

hiding the stat

i know everything that makes me shine

i ‘on’t mind what comes after

i’m on the one selling myself on the line

does he ever talk with sock

does he ever seem like a mind of nirvana

yes i do

always hammering, how am in

ovid height

never me, never will see it

never will go back

took a pact to it

always on my mind

never got to chew it

always put it down right here


[chorus]

flaying this

afraid of this

what to do to equate this

querying another question

nothing off these pages

flaying this

afraid of this

what to do to equate this

querying another question

nothing off these pages

i’ll shrive on, now i’m enough

ignoring the devil

i’ll shrive on, now i’m enough

now you gotta be the one

[verse 2]

i’m a d+mned +rs+d soul

that’s what she says

i ‘on’t ever say text

no, never said it

but i know my likes

it’s like a stupid fate

i’ll never do myself a brig of wraiths

oh no, i don’t ever hear it

oh no, does he ever clip it

do i take another rage

put it in her way

like i don’t ever get it

hope, dead end road

hope, down the road

(laughter)

[outro]

bye to the milf

lady your hike
