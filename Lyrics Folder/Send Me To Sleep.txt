[verse 1]

cajoling

she never looking . . .

a nice say

i’m telling like her something

to be shooting . . .

in the morning on bed

i’m not another rolling

sick in love in bed

all your love

scr+ping and bow

ruining all my hair

i don’t want to wake up

with her hiding here tonight

i just want to sleep next to you

in my head

i don’t wanna wake up

in the middle of the night

i just wanna sing to you a little

send you, send you

send you to sleep

(see me, see me now)

you send me to sleep

(see me now, see me now)

oh you send me to sleep

(see me now, see me now)

ouch! you send me to sleep

(see me now, see me now)
