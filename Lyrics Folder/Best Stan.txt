[intro]

sometimes i don’t . . . here in vain

other times i just have her for say you’re in


[verse 1]

the best place to be

the right place to see

i don’t get the field

sometimes the air is up to you?

i don’t get this place

i don’t get he says

i don’t get every thing in making out of

telling me, dozen in a phone get a raise

i’m begging to my love in ace

and i know, it’s the same, big here

to leaving for something better

better be you

better say true

better to be who true to what i do

best stan, not whoever

on my . . . oh god!
