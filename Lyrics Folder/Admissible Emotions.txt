[verse 1]

sorry i’m offended now

blurry you come with the end’s wind out

attainable intentions

sh+ll sheave off the wall

admissible emotions

it’s all i’m asking for all the

band out

around whose hussy?

building buzz

i can’t

we can’t get out of this love

wane on evеrything

one thing i can’t kept pondering

is how i’m gonna gеt out of this love

oh it hurts just as a memory

[bridge]

got me festering all along all along

can’t get this right

got me festering all along all along

can’t get this right


[chorus]

admissible emotions

emotions

is all i’m asking

i can’t keep up with these dole

admissible emotions

emotions

is all i’m asking

i can’t keep up with these dole


[outro]

still very certain with my pride

hulling in a . . . dip in
