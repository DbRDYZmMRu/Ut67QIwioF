[intro]

take a chance

break all the b rules


[verse 1]

swear you pair me off a fay

tasing all the crepes

she’s dazing all the capes

(daze in all the rays)

ah!

big on everything

(i’m her son)

big on my ambitions

(dawning sun anon)

big on this zeal

(over your town) 


[chorus]

i’ll never serve you

i’ll never save

i who never gave

i’ll never break

i’ll never get it

i’ll never say

i’ll never be brave

i’ll never fail on

i cover the sun

i colour this all

i’m under resolving

resolved, i’ll be going

[verse 2]

we should just take it back

(take it back)

back

we should just . . .

sake the sam

(for the sake of the sam)

we should go

we should go

somewhere where it’ll be just you and i girl

(somewhere h+lla big, see you when i call)

i’ll never get the time

my texts on rewind

but do you ever . . .

will you ever find a time

‘fore you get carted up to that club

you call it milou

bill here

a millionaire in your army

terry, tear it, three

that’s the number that you’ll find me on

call me, coma, clone me

i’ll never hear you go

i’ll be losing my mind

losing my mind

all the time

milli, milli, milli, milli

is that the number where i’m on

three, three, three, three

is number you’ll find me on

i’m losing my mind at this

my mind

losing my mind

[outro]

it’s all complicated

overstated

i’m lost in your heart emotions

do i ever take time

to give up on the seating

all my sitting on everything i hold above

ah
