[chorus]

my mind’s on one

my time is undone

when i’m with another

my mind’s on one

my time is undone

when i’m with another

when i’m not with you


[verse 1]

you make me cry

you make it rain from the sky

oh why you lead with a sign in weep

you, don’t you see that

you’re the girl that makes me flu

feels many weeks before went that i was ensue

for how you make me feel

i’m saying bae

you’re a woman i would love

i love you, i love you

even so well

feels; i ever made it

so cold, i was too far away

may ignore the weather

it gets to us

and now i’m better

if i was the better

could you edge me through it

just be in the starting

could you edge me through it

how i fell down on my own

favourite use, how we fell

help me see you through it all

when i’m down with my vole in will

down with my whole will

each bound

cattle, open to work

all the way down

i’m in your haste

my whole rhyme is to solve her case

my moral height is to offer this

in mind, you’re the one

i’m yours before our peak converse

hands down we have

saying, we will never come back

i will never come back

oh it is just this time

it is just this one time

real time, all, all over

it is real time, it’s burning, burning

and the rain is falling

while my tears is falling

i can’t love this burning

like my field isn’t grilling
