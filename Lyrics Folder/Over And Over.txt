[verse 1]

all you ever say in the movie you’re in

my pain won’t go away

forgive me, a night owl

heavy whee when you’re now

(when you’re now)

truly yours, it’s true that you’re real

(that you’re real)

if this is heaven

then we’re here

really he’s truly rich

are you mad?

you’ve never been


[chorus]

my emotions are over, over

my emotions are over

over me


[verse 2]

flair, a day in the rear

thesе words, a doorway

to my life

i can’t be herе, nothing more

(nothing more)

i can’t sell nothing over this

(nothing over this)

my heart, my love

i lean on the books you’re on
