[intro]

oh

yeah

real friends

real friends

all i ever wanted was some real friend

all i ever wanted was us to be friends


[verse 1]

it’s my life

it’s my strife

so i have got to play my part right

you were the friend that i held tight

didn’t know you were playing my heart like a kite

i was a bait

you took a bite

this bond was never mutual from the start

i didn’t know i was just a p+wn to you

had me in my feelings asking who am i to you

i got lost

cos i wanted to be cool

always looking up to you

felt i had something to prove

i guess i got it all wrong

love comes and it goеs

never thought

ours would be lost

on a stowaway

(to a stowaway of lovе)

love comes and it goes

never thought

ours would be lost

on a stowaway

(to a stowaway of love)

girl, you got me messed up

always looking forward

to a n+ggers next pay day

just a young boy

stacking hay

but you were here

scheming, patiently waiting

till my feelings f+cking faded away

[chorus]

all i ever wanted was a real friend

(friend, thought you were my real friend)

all i ever wanted was us to be friends

like a crab to an oyster

cracked my heart in two

reached for your holster

desecrated our bond for this paper

cos to you it never really mattered

i was just another slipper

all i ever wanted was a real friend

(real, thought you were my real friend)

all i ever wanted was us to be friends


[verse 2]

my babe too cool

i mean so rude

she’s gonna break your heart

and she won’t shed a tear

she’s so mean

with the heart of an angel

l be the name

cos she’s falling from the highest of planes

and she’s taking me down with her

cos my heart’s colder

the dark side of the moon

no room for no more love blooms

consume me till my doom

one more time

let’s make love one more time

i thought you were my real friend

now it seems all you ever did was pretend

it’s my life

it’s my strife

i played the part right

i played the part right

it’s my life

it’s my strife

i played the part right

yeah i played the part right


[chorus]

all i ever wanted was a real friend

(friend, thought you were my real friend)

all i ever wanted was us to be friends

like a crab to an oyster

cracked my heart in two

reached for your holster

desecrated our bond for this paper

cos to you it never really mattered

i was just another slipper

all i ever wanted was a real friend

(real, thought you were my real friend)

all i ever wanted was us to be friends
