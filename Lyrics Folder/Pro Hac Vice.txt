[intro]

and you go

it is another hail

oh she halve her deuces

sailing, and you go

it’s another veer

oh she’d rather you lose it


[verse 1]

eh! pro hac vice

you should take your bag

telling you

there is no marring your vim

i’m other you

i wanna love you

you should learn

weigh your none

when you want what you want

i can’t get it right

when you are gone

my mind is lost

summon me like a p+wn

you should let me never lose it

oh! pro hac vice

you should get your bags back

there is no taking a vial sip

i’m locking on my tay tempt

take your vial sip

momma told me

i could buy your lie; i sip

maybe if i see it

then think it out

i’m not sure what is ringing loud

it is no matter who is talking back

it is just my heart that is burning hard dear

harder

fig it in love

you should never look it in

like another pun

i’m not sure what is different on the law

all you ever do is make me feel lost

make me feel a lot

make me feel lost

you should never take your rib from me

you make me feel lost

you make me feel a lot
