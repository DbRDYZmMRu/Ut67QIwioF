[chorus]

humming the words

humming your name

all again

humming the words

humming your name

juice in my cup

just a mock up

get me through the day

this smooth top

a small talk

get me through the day

[verse 1]

is a smack better

dearth better

couldn’t receive

couldn’t deceive

is this smile better?

is this my betting?

check the recipient

couldn’t reset

hit up p+wn lean

i’d get you

all the time

mow the time

hit up on here

i’ll get it all the timе

more the time


[verse 2]

miss no bish

giving

lip sipping

ah ah

on my way

miss no bish

lip sipping

big giving

big living

tipping on my siеving

i got it on my weaving

her light in my eyes

that’s the reason

and i’m up i am here busy in m.i.a

[chorus]

humming the words

humming your name

all again

humming the words

humming your name

(oh, we yarn)

juice in my cup

just a mock up

get me through the day

this smooth top (smooth)

a small talk

get me through the day
