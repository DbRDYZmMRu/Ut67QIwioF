[chorus]

i don’t want it

i don’t wanna know

i can’t hide it

i can, i can

always on my mind

i can’t buy it

h++rd love up

i can’t hide it

hey

can’t deny it

always on my mind

i can’t buy it

h++rd love up

i can’t hide it

[verse 1]

how it feels when it feels

that i’m on the wrong side of the scale

i ain’t bitter to it

cos i can’t love you the way you want it

i’m locked up in my mind

girl, i can’t hide it

so insensitive

like a decor act

it’s why you’re the target

so beautiful

like an appellative

it is our narrative

picking up my gun

talking, all the cards are in

girl you are

girl you are


[chorus 2]

i don’t want it

always on my mind

i can’t buy it

h++rd lovе up

(all loved up)

i can’t hide it

yeah

i don’t want it

(i’m lovеd up)

i don’t wanna know

i can’t hide it

i can, i can

can’t deny it

(i’m in love)

always on my mind

i can’t buy it

h++rd love up

i can’t hide it

i can’t hide it

[intro]

find me a girl who is pretty in heart

i want her soul

find me a girl with the quiddity of style

mode bankroll


[verse 1]

we should head any day

that’s her foreign

it’s your girl

it’s her; fervent

you should give me your hone

i’m unto piton

this girl, she’s a real nun

and my heart sovereign

holding, it’s sobbing

and my love is on her

it’s no tearing or rent

when i’m with her

i get real h+rny

nil nun

when i’m with her

chasing this feeling

like it’s all i’ve got

she knows my mind’s on her

tux on her, love’s on

everything silent

okay, i hear we going for the sheet

better put my name

better know i’m with the sh+t

however, you goad

(i’m with you)

that we going for this sh+t

she’s something like goose

i’m about to share it

real by the shady

i’m about to share it

yeah, wouldn’t know

cos n0body sharing

despite no one sharing

it’s just me and my girl

h+ll

[outro]

you should know i’ll serve with it

girl every side i’m hitting
