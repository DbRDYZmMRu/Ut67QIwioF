[intro]

(hiccup)

whoa oh she not giver

my girl, she a lover

two fingers down

i’m feeling like i might always be a dealer of art

you make me a dealer


[verse 1]

i swear you wanna see her

making you feel like this ain’t n0body

eh!

my demons and my fate

they ain’t n0body

she has my mind jut up like a lover

i’m always so self+conscious

i think i lost a thought

back to the plot

never got an evil girl

that’s what this is on

all my dawn is always about you

sweet chop

l!cking it up

tweaking my soul

is that a read up?

i’m always caught up in your knead+up

and she knows that i’ma linking it up

oh oh

don’t you leave me

i’ll be calling in an no ozone

oh, oh, hmm

picking me out

she’s picking my label

i’m not sorry, the lay on

you say you’ll . . . i’ll be on it too

too we can level it up

round it lever of two

[chorus]

you’re my aperient flow

my aperient flow

you’re my aperient flow

you make me lose it all


[chorus]

you’re my aperient flow

my aperient flow

you’re my aperient flow

you make me lose it all


[chorus]

you’re my aperient flow

my aperient flow

you’re my aperient flow

you make me lose it all
