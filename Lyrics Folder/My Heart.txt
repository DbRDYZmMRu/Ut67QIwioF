[intro]

oh+oh

it’s your boy theophil


[verse 1]

sometimes i ponder

why my heart goes astray

sometimes i ponder

how is it possible

that my heart still longs for you so bad

i can’t help it

girl you got me lost in our past

it was a flash in the pan

it’s not healthy

girl i need a closure

[chorus]

cos i want you

i don’t wanna ever lose you again

if i have you

come through

girl you know my heart

still beats for you like every day

i want you

i can endure through this pain

but first . .

girl you gotta

fall through

fall through

my girl come through


[verse 2]

my heart still beats for you

i can never lose

i can never lose your heart

(don’t break my heart to pieces)

for nothing

i’m stacking this paper up

i just wanna stack it up with you

(with you)

girl you should know

you’re my dream come true

(true though)

i don’t ever play when it’s about you

(no ojuju)

i wanna get the world for you

if i could get it

(and i will)

i wanna tell you how i feel like

every day, every morning

can’t you see that you brighten up my day

girl!

i love you

i love you

i love you

my heart’s an equation of your touch

i can’t help it

girl you got me spitting out my heart

like torrents of emotion

you got me buried in your portion

so i can’t

i can’t get you out my mind

oh yeah, girl you’re home

girl you gotta love me now

girl we can’t wait for the world to turn around

girl you gotta love me now

girl we can’t wait for the world to come around

eh!

can’t wait to

(mouse cl!ck)
