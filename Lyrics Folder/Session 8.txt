[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

not looking back with my hand on my fort

oh you’re looking for someone dull

leaped her train

not my fault

easy nut

is it not

looking like i got a bed

with zero feeling

girl who got

girl who got no bun

i’ll die looking out with my hand on my fort

oh my gawd

i saw an envelope hanging with some fraud

height of my shirt

hope to clean them in a flood

i fed same dud? odd


[verse 1]

kinness, to your nest

him next, all i want is your noise

illness, heal me next, fullness

your noise, all i want is theo the nerd

girl you got my heart

heart

and i can’t come down

can’t come down

girl you got my heart

oh, take my stairs

it’d suck if you’re vote

trust your votе cos i fell whole

ending, no we arе at the start

and i don’t care who’s chart

all alone i was shy

all along in the court with you

[chorus]

not looking back with my hand on my fort

oh you’re looking for someone dull

leaped her train

not my fault

easy nut

is it not

looking like i got a bed

with zero feeling

girl who got

girl who got no bun

i’ll die looking out with my hand on my fort

oh my gawd

i saw an envelope hanging with some fraud

height of my shirt

hope to clean them in a flood

i fed same dud? odd
