[intro]

she’s got a date

she’s got a dart gun


[verse 1]

sometimes i can think of nothing better

other times i guard my lawn

humming times, i can’t think of nothing better

and when you’re around

though i lie, i see something better

dribble with me

say with me

i see you, who you are

i see you who you are

baby, still; who you are


[verse 2]

every thing lost

soon, i will make a cut off

i’m tryna drown my thoughts

i don’t ever cart it

i’m just saying my love

it’s not over with your hero

and i know i am tainted

but i know it is never harrowing

sorry baby

i can’t take my stolen heart in parts

giving you are home

i never stay away

i’m nevеr a player

. . . too, where you arе

and here i was

a sync to my watch

i take on a place in time
