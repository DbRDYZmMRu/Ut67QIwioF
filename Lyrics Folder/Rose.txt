[verse 1]

how you feel so hurt

that won’t make me bill the heart

how stale

saddened just cry it out in the sun

ah!

the sun comes out

feeling it is a little waned

i might just bid my winnings

weighing my love

if it will matter

i found a plot of better matter

that’s me, this is me now

don’t you bother

i come out weasel

i’ma sing something

i want you to come home

i’m home, i’m home

i don’t need to feel grown up

i’ma be better like this

stays honest

[verse 2]

coming back

topping that

crony leaning on my head

like something that

makes love come around

and take what arе the thoughts

i am fading

i’m feeling like this nevеr fading

i’m feeling like i didn’t have a forte

my fingers never touched your body

but it touched you

wear a feeling

i love that

h+llo dad

love her, my personal

my everything

locking all my seals

ah (laughter)

motions in providence

ah!

love friend doesn’t cost a thing

they say

but it cost whatever

i’m better

feeling like i might be bothered

i got it on me like lines and quarters

i’m feeling like this is not a new border

another cruft in the

f+cking kitty kitty kiddie

feeling like you ever had a f+cking wedding

tulle in, meaning, feeling

ah!

her stove burning on this sh+t like winning

all my time i’ll be feeling with the headphones

chord it off this spit

like our tones oh

but it never went past

whoa! who? whose? whoa! it is rose

serendipity
