[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

adios

it came with the words from a prose

landed just behind the poachers

and they came running after

for your love for me

it’s getting wild

don’t get us out extinct

and i’ve been far away with my glasses

tryna find something i’ll find over passes

uh, while i’m out here saying


[verse 1]

at your service girl

do you like it when it’s clear

how i feel doesn’t head for resell

fell lower than i got it

how you fill milk, card i got in

with this call, do i get another diss count?

p+wning out through your pound

whatever it is

ever beautiful, girl you’re еver beautiful

[chorus]

adios

it came with thе words from a prose

landed just behind the poachers

and they came running after

for your love for me

it’s getting wild

don’t get us out extinct

and i’ve been far away with my glasses

tryna find something i’ll find over passes

uh, while i’m out here saying


[verse 2]

it doesn’t matter now

i don’t wanna be a sad clown

while i’m hanging in the shadows for the town

singing melodies of how i much loved you in the past

not requited

on my low, i’m so island of heath

hurt, i don’t wanna live through, not today

none today

maybe on a sunday i’ll get to my bad ways


[outro]

adios

it came with the words from a prose

landed just behind the poachers

and they came running after

for your love for me
