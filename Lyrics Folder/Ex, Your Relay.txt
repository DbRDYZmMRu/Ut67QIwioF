[intro]

and the party starts

she’s missing me

a+list

she has the say in yearn


[verse 1]

we got the friday hot

we just gotta take a law

take it slow

come on, we are riding out

we got the cadi out

just gotta take a slake

we’re slow

i had something in my drink

hickey her nova reign

a cut of her . . . the vein

hookey nickel rare sipping

i need my drink

you can have your wreck

we could just take it slow

tow a sunlight like that

it is no time

no time

i’m just chilling with my girl

tryna find out who is living

to the times

it is no time

i’m turnt

i’m just ch+nk in the fam

my love

. . . еx, your relay

she’s nevеr had . . . you said?

she’s never had a seer

she’ll ever give it on a low

she never had a saint

never had a sabre

she then tried; mummy

keeping on her low

[verse 2]

i’m still buzzing with my door

never found out

what happened last night

cos i was stuck in a cab

and i had to find the right spur

when i hit my car

but i never got it right

cos i was lost in the club

my mind on sever right?

my thoughts never put it right on the track

my love slow stuck on the back of my purse

and i never found the right time

cos i’m always lost in your eyes

with you, feeling like it never changes

when i’m lost, i’m never running on the red

film record, i’m never lost when i’m stuck

you’re wishing i was dash

she’s always on my godd+mn mind

i can’t get it right all the time

but i’m still hoisting my love

revving


[outro]

home, oh

twilling

mixing with the already out here man

weaving

ah i don’t know
