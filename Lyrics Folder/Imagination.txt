[intro]

fresh boy chilling 


[verse 1]

sweet baby

you tell me

that you have it

and i see it

i can feel it

when i’m holding my cell phone

and i have these thoughts

i wanna be with you

forever and ever

cos my thoughts don’t lie to me

lie to me, bride to me

i will say

i would quiet if they ever do

and my time

how can i spend more of it with you

course this feeling

say they’re true

looking for something

that’ll help with a new view

and all that comes between us

nothing more than our imagination

[chorus]

just believe it

when i say that

i love you, i love you

then can’t you see it

you’re so beautiful

oh so beautiful


[verse 2]

time passes, lives gone

and so many lies that have been told

wishing i could stake my time

to tell you something more . . .

eloquent

cos it isn’t how i feel

bouncing to this

living life like i don’t see it

girl isn’t much i will say

but can you see that face

imagination

(hold on to imagination)


[chorus]

just believe it

(oh)

when i say that

i love you, i love you

(just believe it)

then can’t you see it

(oi)

you’re so beautiful

(love)

oh so beautiful

(beaut)

[outro]

time passes, lives gone

and so many lies that have been told
