[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

oh oh oh oh

tell me how you feel

wake me, take me, save a part of me

when you wave me down

tell it, make sure you save it

i feel that love doesn’t fall off

no matter how fast it goes

oh oh

this is not the rodeo of a fast life

oh oh

this fuss to your stay


[chorus]

and i feel, what you feel

quilling honest h+ll it’s a canticle

and i feel, what you feel

peace on this fuss here, it’s gotta go

and borders, we’re growing old

we’re growing in our run

and poor diary rust

going nowhere

it’s going nowhere what i feel

[verse 2]

take me in the morning likе a multivitamin pill

wish on a well, tell it a foul

i give off thе right shot in neon

peeving in tine

what you gonna savour

listen to the heavy heart reoccurring

baby don’t you say it

i got my heart on a letter to you


[chorus]

and i feel, what you feel

quilling honest h+ll it’s a canticle

and i feel, what you feel

peace on this fuss here, it’s gotta go

and borders, we’re growing old

we’re growing in our run

and poor diary rust

going nowhere

it’s going nowhere what i feel


[outro]

dreaming, i hope that i receive it
