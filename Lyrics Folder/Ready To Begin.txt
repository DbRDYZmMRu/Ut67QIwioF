[chorus]

it’s your boy frith spilling

done with it

down with it

done with it

down with it


[verse 1]

mind like metal

inhale premeditated

not experimental

what’s your name?

gotta hold you down

for dreary weather

when am down

i wield it wild

am westly on triggers

laevulose

leave her for toast

she winks i ain’t no comatose

beading hits on that abacus

sterile steel

dwindle my paradox

pit it, stir it

muck around her yummy pool

bounce back off a billiard curb

nip slip

my favourite brush

pyre wire for the nut

and am out

thanks for the rush

bad city

toll the bell with a coin

yeah it’s my biddy

hit that booty once

bet it gonna back

yeah she with it

she never tepid

so hot

she subterranean

alien got my soul boxed up

aquarian

i glow i know

but she loves a running noose

beseeching soul

she wanna rule a haughty heart

charisma underpants

it’s sophistry up your ass

huff off that purée

she could be liberian

sin city

that’s besides the point

just a remark

wager digits off the mark

plop, counting up the smacks

that’s it

i’m a bad piper

with a better left hand

i’m picking this seal

never resend

[chorus]

it’s your boy frith spilling

done with it

down with it

done with it

down with it


[outro]

down with it

down with it

done with it

done with it

down with it
