[intro]

sometimes i don’t feel real

most times i don’t know

if it is happening

or it is done

it is how you have my heart

wrecking all the days

i be gone

now it feels everything i say

if it is done

help me see through it all

without a why though

help me see through it all

i think i’ma ride

[verse 1]

i need to put my mind

where it is right

i need to get my mind at the job lovers

i need to get my mind off the reasons

oh, oh, oh

why did i ever get this sh+t started

i thought i had a reason for starters

i’m stuck in my bas+m+nt a bother

and i don’t know if i can any harder

cos i’m feeling like a stutter

ah!

from the jump start, it was a order

now it feels that

i am not going nowhеre without you

i need you here

d+mn, i miss you nеar

why you gotta behave so weird

reaching for you across the tears

it is so bad

feeling this way

i don’t know if i can take it no more

it feels so bad, feeling this way

i want pain, just till i feel something

for starters

i want to be free

for starters

honey, i just wanna think clearly

nowadays

vanity in me increasing

and it feels so bad

everything i ever held back

now it’s driving me to tears

how can i get it out of there

push back, push back

writ her, reach out

she says it will be fine

[outro]

all i need to do

is to put my problems

where they serve in the thrash

all i need to do

is to put my worries

where they serve right in the pain

i’m not winning

if you’re not here with me

i need no validation but your love

my tears on chime

when i feel this way

i may just go around and say

i am waiting

i am waiting here with a broken heart

ah!

i am waiting here with a soured love

yeah, i am waiting

i am waiting here with a bottle open

and i am drowning every cork

that i ever shot at

oh f+ck
