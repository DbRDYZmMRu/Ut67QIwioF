[intro]

How long do you think we’ve been staring at the window?

[verse 1]

A heart warming

A basket full of pancakes

You tell me it’s okay

[bridge]

A dizzy morning

Feeling i don’t wanna

Help it but here

Tell me it’s fair

[chorus]

That i love you in ways

That nothing can afford

But to stay here every time

To savour your time

That i love you in ways

That nothing can afford

But to stay here every time

To savour your time

[verse 2]

The patient strip

Telling of a time

Our takeoff

Afraid of

[bridge]

A dizzy morning

Feeling i don’t wanna

Help it but here

Tell me it’s fair

[chorus]

That i love you in ways

That nothing can afford

But to stay here every time

To savour your time

That i love you in ways

That nothing can afford

But to stay here every time

To savour your time

[outro]

Fresh boy chilling
