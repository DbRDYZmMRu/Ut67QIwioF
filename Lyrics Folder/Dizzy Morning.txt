[intro]

how long do you think we’ve been staring at the window?


[verse 1]

a heart warming

a basket full of pancakes

you tell me it’s okay


[bridge]

a dizzy morning

feeling i don’t wanna

help it but here

tell me it’s fair


[chorus]

that i love you in ways

that nothing can afford

but to stay here every time

to savour your time

that i love you in ways

that nothing can afford

but to stay here every time

to savour your time


[verse 2]

the patient strip

telling of a time

our takeoff

afraid of

[bridge]

a dizzy morning

feeling i don’t wanna

help it but here

tell me it’s fair


[chorus]

that i love you in ways

that nothing can afford

but to stay here every time

to savour your time

that i love you in ways

that nothing can afford

but to stay here every time

to savour your time
