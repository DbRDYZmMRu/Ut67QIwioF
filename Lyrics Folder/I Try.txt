[intro]

Fresh boy chilling

Oh oh

Oh

[chorus]

I so many times try to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

[bridge]

Feelings coming down

Hidden code

When you’re around

Feel the ritz all around

How it goes

To another round

[verse 1]

I get it i’m so easy

Looking for another beauty

I know it’s not my duty

Saying how good you’re looking today

But girl you got me

From a mile away i’m betwixt

Oh girl you got me

My heart flawed

Mind your applaud, i’ll do it

I try, i try

[chorus]

I so many times try to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

I try so many times to fight over how i feel

[bridge]

Feelings coming down

Hidden code

When you’re around

Feel the ritz all around

How it goes

To another round
