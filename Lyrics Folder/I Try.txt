[intro]

fresh boy chilling

oh oh

oh


[chorus]

i so many times try to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel


[bridge]

feelings coming down

hidden code

when you’re around

feel the ritz all around

how it goes

to another round


[verse 1]

i get it i’m so easy

looking for another beauty

i know it’s not my duty

saying how good you’re looking today

but girl you got me

from a mile away i’m betwixt

oh girl you got me

my heart flawed

mind your applaud, i’ll do it

i try, i try

[chorus]

i so many times try to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel

i try so many times to fight over how i feel


[bridge]

feelings coming down

hidden code

when you’re around

feel the ritz all around

how it goes

to another round
