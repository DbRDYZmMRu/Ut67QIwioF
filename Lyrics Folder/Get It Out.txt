[intro]

tell me now

how do we go about this


[verse 1]

sometimes i find

sometimes i don’t give a f+ck

sometimes it feels like the last

was the our side of the pastime

and i’m feeling like i got it on a hang

and i’m caught in my other self

these things don’t work out

these things don’t tear me no more

and i know i gotta let it go

if i wanna take control


[chorus]

do i get it out

do i get it out

am i more than what i hope for

do i get it out

do i get it out

am i more than what i hope for


[verse 2]

time passes and i don’t give a f+ck

i’m on my job like i’m tryna get herе subbed

no bothers?

no it borders it all

no wondеr it’s just me and my luck

oh am i her dark cry

i’m a dog cry

do i ever say: here on dodge

the reasons of my past

[outro]

something like that you know

i like
