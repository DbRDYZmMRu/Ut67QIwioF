[intro]

oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


[chorus]

she just had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

wholly whole addy all doubt

had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

and she got my heart in a safe box

can never say

when the scene sunk

bob

[verse 1]

hands in pocket

dreg in bottle

emptying my sum

it’s another day

and she knows it right

ignores it all right

hands in the air

my thoughts can’t get out of here


[bridge]

i need you on my lawn

oh


[chorus]

she just had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

wholly whole addy all doubt

had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

and she got my heart in a safe box

can never say

when the scene sunk

bob


[verse 2]

hip with the party

hating the hurting

oh

feeling done

aim in the party

chained with the heartache

not the sin

aim in the party

could have been home

[bridge]

i need you on my lawn

oh


[chorus]

she just had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

wholly whole addy all doubt

had her way, hideaway

oh whoa

and she got my heart in a safe box

can never say

when the scene sunk

bob


[outro]

hands in the air

can’t get my thoughts out of here
