[verse 1]

she said she’ll find me

when she talk to me in here

i ask about the cards and the written prose

she’ll find me not in this book

she’ll find me

not on another song

she’ll find me

not on my x

she’ll find me

somewhere, when she’s exed up her head

i think i know that line

i think i know that time

when we had our first hi


[verse 2]

she’ll be missing now

shape your wishing author

kites flowing over my bedroom

the times havе changed

i still can’t find what i left

what is on therе

assail, i’ll move my things

i fear that nothing comes up

no, nah, no

i fear that nothing is up

uh+oh

[verse 3]

wake me up,

wake me, you’re up

wake me up,

wake me, you’re up

wake me, you’re up


[outro]

well, how you’ll find me

well, will you find me?
