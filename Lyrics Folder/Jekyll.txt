[intro]

oh+oh+oh+oh


[chorus]

i’m the jekyll who is always

always in love

and she knows that my heart flutters

i’m the rebel who’s never picking calls

whoa


[verse 1]

tell me that i made it

to the front row

call it tabu

my mind’s on

it’s on you

think her code a shot

put her where the longing is

in new den

it never comes down

it never comes down

when i’m with you

not when i’m with you

[bridge]

cos, you’re always here

take care rib, now it’s always here

oh, i do

oh my dear, it is always here

sell you away

oh, it is always


[verse 2]

oh i am not myself

don’t need a bottle to feel it

don’t need another top to top my love

i’m right here, saying that it is over

and nearer again

i don’t see your piece of missing, h+ll no

cos it feels that you’re always here

singing in my head

prepare, i ain’t dying now, you know


[chorus]

i’m the jekyll who is always

always in love

and she knows that my heart flutters

i’m the rebel who’s never picking calls

whoa
