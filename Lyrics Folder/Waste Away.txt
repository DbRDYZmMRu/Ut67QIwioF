[intro]

I suddenly became hyper aware of my body

I don’t know what music that is

That music is all they have

You want me to turn it off

[verse 1]

Hey

Take a dive down

I get it all the time

Am i or you’re here

Take the old bye

And put it in a box and say

You will bear it with your hands

[verse 2]

Dozen like here

Does he ever think of more than

He could ever take

He could ever brace

[verse 3]

Light in my eye

Biting my pie

I don’t give a f ck

What they say about me

Light in my eye

Biting my pie

I won’t give it to you

It’s there in new york

[bridge]

No to anyone but you

My lover say nothing

No to no one but you

My lover say nothing

[verse 4]

Pretty, are my kisses on me

More kisses on me

Pretty, would kisses on me

More kisses on me

I can feel it not now

I can see it, but how

I can feel it not now

I can see it, but how

I can see it, but how

[chorus]

Wasting away

Waste me away

Do we ever feign

Waste me away

Waste me away

Do we ever feign how we’re feeling

Healing leaving

When you’re not here

Feeling, feeling leaving

Waste me away

Waste me away

Do we ever feign how we’re feeling

Waste me away

Waste me away

Do we ever feign how we’re feeling

[outro]

Say you’re here

But how
