[chorus]

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind

heaven knows clouds can’t let down my thoughts

thoughts streamed through the pain of another shot

yeah, i let it; sunk

let my emotions burn

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind

[verse 1]

heaven knows i ‘on’t wanna be alone

p+ssing on all my dirty draws

messy piece that’s the mot in my f+cking mind

dumbing on a drone

easing the being alone

exhale just to ebb the tears

(breathing)

all alone all alone

how it feels

i can’t get my line of feel

got my attitude undulated

it’s еxcruciating

i can’t let go of this pain

when i let in, why do you cut mе deeper

the way you cut me deeper


[chorus]

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind

heaven knows clouds can’t let down my thoughts

thoughts streamed through the pain of another shot

yeah, i let it; sunk

let my emotions burn

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind

[chorus]

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind

heaven knows clouds can’t let down my thoughts

thoughts streamed through the pain of another shot

yeah, i let it; sunk

let my emotions burn

here we go again

d+mn!

i can’t get you outta my mind
