[verse 1]

does it feel like

we fell in love over christmas

i know if you say

love or the piste sins

i’m on my way, and i’m going check the thesis

our love in the sole

like a wrist tease

oh, only the one

girl you should know

this is soul

ride on my mind like a fool

and it is scheming right at you

cull sigh

talk to me, even a lie

talk to me rile

you know you, you run

ransom by

girl no, it’s on pi

oh, i’ll hold your hand
