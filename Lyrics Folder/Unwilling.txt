[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

i’m so unwilling to go on with this love

after the cart, i see there is nothing in here

i’m unwilling to go on with this loam

i’d severe the bare pain

i see there is nothing here


[verse 1]

you got my heart so devastated

how you make me feel

so underrated

feeling this way

i can feel sated

get out of my world

is often praised

i can go for my lie, incels


[verse 2]

how do i get to me?

how do i get to me?

i say often times

when you take my soul away from me

telling me i don’t own it anymore

how do i get to me?

how do i get to me?

when you take my soul away

and you say it’s not mine anymore

[bridge]

all these d+mn ones and zeros

all these d+mn computers

got me feeling, it’s zeros

so you’re the warden

each stop, of the boss send bills

all these d+mn ones and zeros

all these d+mn computers

got me feeling like keys

so you’re lingering


[chorus]

i’m so unwilling to go on with this love

(i can’t go with this, i’m getting off now)

after the cart, i see there is nothing in here

(even if it’s us now)

i’m unwilling to go on with this loam

(i can’t go with this, i’m getting off now)

i’d severe the bare pain

(no, heart taking no press down)

i see there is nothing here


[outro]

cos it’s obvious

i’m the one with no soul

it’s obvious
