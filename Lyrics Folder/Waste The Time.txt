[intro]

oh!

time passes

and the strangeness of our dreams

fades into the page

and it is mottled

with a lot of colours

there is green

there is blue

there is orange

there is so much you know

it just has to be in design

[chorus]

always waste the time

never hit rewind

me and my friends never did the drop

hit the drop to the spot

light another one up

always waste the time

never hit rewind

me and my friends never did the drop

hit the drop to the spot

light another one up


[verse 1]

cos we never gave a f+ck

that’s a f+cking duck

surf of shots

thats our f+cking lot

now my car packed up in the freaking lot

halo on all my brothers

barriers for all em suckers

nuts for em haters

switching pages maybe i meet u later


[bridge]

pretty mots wanna ride my way

i ‘on’t give a f+ck what is it you ate today

like my haircut

that’s no worry on no mother dawdler day

i’m just trekking with my girl

it is feeling like i got a billion in my account

everything is fine

(fine, fine, fine, fine)

[chorus]

always waste the time

never hit rewind

me and my friends never did the drop

hit the drop to the spot

light another one up


[verse 2]

and it goes this way

never hit a girl

with a blind spot

be on top watch

when i’m burning

i hold a frieze gaze

till my tall vase

that’s a touring

now my nuff is on the rim

they could afford that
