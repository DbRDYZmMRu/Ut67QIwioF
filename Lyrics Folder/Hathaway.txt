[intro]

fresh boy chilling

i guess it is the reason why i am in love anyway

just being able to be myself

ah!


[verse 1]

tell me what you want

is it a bother if it is what i want

because i know you like

everything being polar

i think i’ve got a new caller

i’m not sure if it is trinity i hear from

or is it i’m not back at the dressing room

oh+oh


[chorus]

sipping on a gatorade

feelings just like hathaway

i’m done running away from you

yeah, does your heart feel or wonder

with a stuntman, i’ll become unglued

sipping on a gatorade

feelings just like hathaway

i’m done running away from you

does your heart feel or wonder

with a stuntman, will i f+cking become ungluеd

[verse 2]

i’m done searching for your love

found it so many timеs

d+mn, i log it

then i got a reading

sike, i caught the way i’m living

no, i’ll ignore the staff

looking for what better

it’s weekend, like camera on your stuff

i love how you talk

is it how you walking, wet around

i saw we’re clammer talking

i’d hop by, but you’re not around

is it true she’s not as rad as that

i don’t know, i only see her on tv


[chorus]

sipping on a gatorade

feelings just like hathaway

i’m done running away from you

yeah, does your heart feel or wonder

with a stuntman, i’ll become unglued

sipping on a gatorade

feelings just like hathaway

i’m done running away from you

does your heart feel or wonder

with a stuntman, will i f+cking become unglued

[verse 3]

take me, love me

love me all over

make me the star of all your movies

(laughter)

let me start that again
