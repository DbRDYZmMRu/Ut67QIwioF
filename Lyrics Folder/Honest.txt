[intro]

Fresh boy chilling

Sometimes a phase

We fail, you’re tying me

[verse 1]

This emotion still pink, a vain

Saying something to my ears

I can’t defy

I just gotta be on my kneels

Say it one time like

I think i caught a fever, leave her

Saying twice

Too many words in my head

Focusing on what is important

Seems to be disgusting

When it’s to you

Oh when it’s not you

I just wanna sing out

[bridge]

We should pay tribute to love

Not this way, not the sway

[chorus]

Loving to be real doesn’t have to be honest

I could just say that i want your love

At the moment we just gotta let it all go

Let all the problеms wait at the door

[verse 2]

Cos my heart is beating fastеr

Than the words you’re saying to me girl

I guess we could tell on the bed

When i’m heavy on you

I hope my weight is not pushing too much

You wonder how he does it too hard now

Does it too hard now

[bridge 2]

I know we are cheaters

Leavers of the ones we love

Who is the most

Who is the best player

And you say

It could never be me

Oh oh

[chorus]

Loving to be real doesn’t have to be honest

I could just say that i want your love

At the moment we just gotta let it all go

Let all the problems wait at the door
