[intro]

fresh boy chilling

sometimes a phase

we fail, you’re tying me


[verse 1]

this emotion still pink, a vain

saying something to my ears

i can’t defy

i just gotta be on my kneels

say it one time like

i think i caught a fever, leave her

saying twice

too many words in my head

focusing on what is important

seems to be disgusting

when it’s to you

oh when it’s not you

i just wanna sing out


[bridge]

we should pay tribute to love

not this way, not the sway


[chorus]

loving to be real doesn’t have to be honest

i could just say that i want your love

at the moment we just gotta let it all go

let all the problеms wait at the door

[verse 2]

cos my heart is beating fastеr

than the words you’re saying to me girl

i guess we could tell on the bed

when i’m heavy on you

i hope my weight is not pushing too much

you wonder how he does it too hard now

does it too hard now


[bridge 2]

i know we are cheaters

leavers of the ones we love

who is the most

who is the best player

and you say

it could never be me

oh oh


[chorus]

loving to be real doesn’t have to be honest

i could just say that i want your love

at the moment we just gotta let it all go

let all the problems wait at the door
