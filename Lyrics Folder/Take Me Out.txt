[intro]

fresh boy chilling

i try to work it out myself

but although i tame myself

not the one right next to you


[verse 1]

bail me

tell me that you’ll always be there

i hear voices in my loud window

telling me i don’t care

about you

i mean me

now don’t i hear it right girl

i could be a sad boy

but i prefer just being a d+mn bell boy

broken a lot of things at my heart

whole lot of things lying

my love sold

believe my love sold out long time ago


[bridge]

well i’m shut off, a shard of

f+ck, now of a sort

that i have in, that i haven’t

that i have in mind

that i am short of shy

help me for y’all i have in mind

[chorus]

whеre she’ll find my heart

first callеr

now i’m lost in my heart

looking for gordon

i need to find him


[verse 2]

these days hoping

caregiver has gotten in the room

cult nigh in now

listen up, pay kid heed

is the taking it easy

take it easier

and i feel d+mn

might like her way better

and i feel that i could like her holocaust

now they say your prayers

just take me somewhere

i’ll say: ego her own

might get controlled

i lose it on the floor

i lose it on the floor


[outro]

take me out

to meow

tell me how

tell me you know how to

take me out

tell me y’all

tell me y’all

tell me you’re out

to me y’all

to new york

to new york

tell me

to you all i owe

take me out

take me out

take me out
