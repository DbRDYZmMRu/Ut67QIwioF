[intro]

pretender, tell me you ten down

only see you, not around town

pretender, tell me you ten down

only see you, not around town


[chorus]

my bedroom doesn’t give a f+ck

sum our covalence

plant your evil box

tame a panging swat

teem, teem

count the music down

explain the come around

all year, it’s your reeling on

smear me up in maple syrup season

tell me who is deceiving

ill blotchy wedding

to a man who is well in

i could be your blue heeler (well i)

right now, i’m your boo sheila

baby, your boîte it’s my mood weather

[verse 1]

tom hanging

i’m bailing

i’m not saying

it’s ringing

she’s just my lovе whose calling

with just my heart she’s toying

ah

look at mе, when you talk clear

i’m bubba frith, oh it’s a bother

it’s a doobry do

draw the curtain

it should be we willing two

unplug your b+ttons


[bridge]

pretender, tell me you ten down

only see you, not around town

pretender, tell me you ten down

only see you, not around town


[chorus]

my bedroom doesn’t give a f+ck

sum our covalence

plant your evil box

tame a panging swat

teem, teem

count the music down

explain the come around

all year, it’s your reeling on

smear me up in maple syrup season

tell me who is deceiving

ill blotchy wedding

to a man who is well in

i could be your blue heeler (well i)

right now, i’m your boo sheila

baby, your boîte it’s my mood weather

[verse 2]
