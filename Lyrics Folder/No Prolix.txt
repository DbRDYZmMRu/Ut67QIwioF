i can’t do without her

i can’t do without her

[verse 1]

had me feeling this ain’t no prolix

this is about us

uh!

and my heart still beats

likened kin

get you out of my

i’m in your head

eh!

is it easy just to see it how i say it

i don’t know

wiggle it like you laying on a li+lo

wing it like a little loud

make it, like i’ll be the lamb

when you are last seen i know

it keeps turning around

turning around

my head spinning on a lever

you lay alone

it keeps turning around

turning around

my head fixed in

now you’re playing delilah

the more i see you on that sh+t

modal share

the modal share

i like that sh+t

skip the lottery

1+2 go

and we stop at 1+3

[verse 2]

wow

and i know, and i know

shе loves me

sometimеs i can’t get it right

can’t get it right

sometimes i don’t feel right

don’t feel right

how you got me

it has me tendon

aim now

how you house me thimble

uh+whoa+oh+oh

the way you help me

when you tend your farm

when are you coming around

i’m the one who kept my glowing skin

i want it for you all day alone

treat all your trip

all for the night

yeah
