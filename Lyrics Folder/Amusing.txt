[verse 1]

do you find it amusing

that i am here

musing over our thoughts

over here, i’m the only horror

i wonder if you’ll ever have me take it back

i wonder if you’ll ever have me

retrace my steps

raising my voice a little bit

a little bit higher

take my words back

word i saved

i love her

and lose it over her with another

won’t say i love her

and lose it over another

even if it’s you


[chorus]

do you find it amusing

i’m owing my scream

i’m painting the scene

leaving out nothing

i fell over everything

i assailed

i took down my arbitrary train

[verse 2]

it hurts

it’s burdening than the words

it breaks my thoughts

showing mule . .

am i having a mirth

she can sue my nerve

for a soul with sighing

have my words with my past

it’s like how i’m honest to share my worst

to repel the beauty and the fancy

does it get scarier

when you take away the comforts


[chorus]

do you find it amusing

i’m owing my scream

i’m painting the scene

leaving out nothing

i fell over everything

i assailed

i took down my arbitrary train
