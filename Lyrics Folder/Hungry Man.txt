[verse 1]

register, i’m taking my affairs seriously

i don’t give a f+ck what they say

i’m with the facade like an edifice

i don’t give a f+ck what they put on this time

i’m a man

so you come around and help me with my plans

you can have my hands

say my name, i get it

i don’t give a f+ck what they say on the reddit

what they put on my very frame

got my headphones

saying i was plugged

taking her sorrow

not good a goal

i don’t know

what put me on

maybe it is a taste of this or diss or these days

you want me in more tears

why

you want me and i don’t get it

[verse 2]

chapter, there a freak o lane

i’m not what you say i pray

am i the devil

i’m not the only one

am i the one who has never been better

it just gets quieter

when i take my time

i ponder when the song makes it mine

does it ever make it mine

your smile go a long line

meaning i’m alone


[outro]

maybe a rothschild smile, hmm

new m

i remember in my office

like just being myself

just like

oh, i’ll never meet one

like never, or talk to one
