[verse 1]

i wish i could say

i love you

i wish i could say

i’ll do it all over

cos my goodbye has come

and i have to ride with you

with you, with you, with you

i gotta handle a raccoon

it’s giving me all the lead buddy


[verse 2]

and i can say whatever

band whatever

gal on you

hit me with the curve, the scary

got me feeling like i could be the one


[chorus]

on a note, respiring

my time not starting up

she said, she said

it don’t have to end

my time, my time not starting right now

she said it is a nay

it doesn’t end

[verse 3]

body on body all i ever dream

all i ever dream

i count three

body on body it’s all i evеr dream

am i really real

bеcause she mine and i’m just high

high on marge, you are a séance


[outro]

loving, loving all the time

loving, loving, loving all the time
