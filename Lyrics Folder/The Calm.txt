[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

reminiscing, can i beat it

now i got it

end, no travelling

everything feels

cooler right here

i’m better that i am right here

when i get here

i thought i had already


[bridge]

swimming in a pond of sharks

how can i lack

when i was brought up how i was

bet i put my back

going dark every time when i hold a frown

am i the child with the calm

come on, lime checked

so much spam on me

when i look a calm on me

so much spam on me

something like

the only cam is for my ass

[verse 2]

and i am fine with that

feeling like i got another track

come on, come sniff it out

i’m locking the safe

saving out all my debts

if we work, we are reoccurring

on my . . . say record

and i feel that

feeling nothing

fear in nothing

seeing nothing

begging in none


[verse 3]

where are your errors

it’s dangling and you’re a noun

saying i was playing the scene

you’re dead

feigning i know hope

it ain’t dead

meaning in meme

is all i can grapple

is turned to trace

look in my face

bet she’s gonna be my favourite lady

and i know what’s to say you’re good
