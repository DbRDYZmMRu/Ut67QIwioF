[intro]

oh+oh

do we ever say

do we ever pay for all the hurt


[verse 1]

i’m lost on my own

girl don’t until you do

girl i’m dust on my own

i love when i look in your fair

help me catch a phrase of your thought again

help me catch a face of your thought again

it’s real

having a year old

my love for you is feeling of odin

i’m not lost in my conscience

talking about this all over again

all over again

i could take my poet away

i could face my demons

i could take this caller all the away

with this heart

with this heart of mine

with this solid ground

i call all of mine to

how you have it

talking about this heartache

i need mine, it’s over

it’s you

every other time it’s you

i tell my time for two

not more than two again

girl it’s you

i talk more sh+t for two

not more than two again

[verse 2]

big boy in the f+cking club

feeling like a toy

big doll in the d+mn club

feeling like she’s got the cotch

just ignore the other

it starts this love that’s bothers

it’s just this love that’s bothering

my d+mn soul

if you can’t get enough

i’ma just choke on all i’ve bought

all i’ve bought

tell me it’s not enough

i need you to be

blanket from this dawn
