[intro]

missing you

missing you

then why hold it back

let the words

i ‘on’t really mean


[verse 1]

when he is down for you

he’s down, real down

how i lose my d+mn mind

when he is down for you

he’s down

how i godd+mn lose my mind

take my love

it’s a fight when you got it

don’t know ma

how i lose it

take my love girl

when you got it

i can’t put a finger how i lose you

talk to me

don’t you hold back

my heart it is on wait

it is not going back

nothing ever phases me

it is just this love

i don’t want yours fizzling out

we got about a minute to hold it down

i ‘on’t know if my mind is slowly soaring around

[outro]

cut that sh+t out

i changed my mind

thank you
