[verse 1]

sealing heart

whoa o+o+o

i’m on fire


[chorus]

she got the vibe on fire

my heart’s not on denial

i’m host her flyer


[bridge]

tip tip

telling me where you are

beep beep

girl ring my heart

girls are fulcra

take away the pain

my love’s another weather to escape

[verse 1]

i’ve been waiting here

best days

heights

nudging all her rush

i’ve been cooling your flanks

and girl quails

bail a bitty iffier

tell me now

if it’s gonna be good

or legging it

i’m like

do the right thing

i can’t let it go on a rudder

you makе my heart snider

how poor your coal!


[chorus]

she got thе vibe on fire

my heart’s not on denial

i’m host her flyer

she got the vibe on fire

my heart’s not on denial

i’m host her flyer


[bridge]

tip tip

telling me where you are

beep beep

girl ring my heart

girls are fulcra

take away the pain

my love’s another weather to escape

[chorus]

she got the vibe on fire

my heart’s not on denial

i’m host her flyer

she got the vibe on fire

my heart’s not on denial

i’m host her flyer


[outro]

n0body telling me

telling me

bet it’s my dome

i’m taking her

eh!

n0body telling me

telling me

when it’s mine, huh

i’m taking her home (home)

i love her with the cowboy hat

she got the smile that make you wanna jump first

eh!

ain’t n0body telling me

ain’t filling my cup

but she’s busy down there

tsk+tsk

trip, trip, trip, trip, tripping

now i’m lost with this constant l!cking
