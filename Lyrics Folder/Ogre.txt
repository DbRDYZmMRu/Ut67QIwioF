[verse 1]

if my time don’t come

i’ll put everything i have in a . . .

and i’ll be gone

stuck up

i’m lost in the mood

and i’m feeling like i’m foe ogre

my lie, he’s back on the wall

i call the shots

now i’m pulling the rug

i’m pulling the rug

on my nose

on my nose

i ‘on’t ever, ever know

on my nose

on my nose

i ‘on’t ever, ever know

if my time don’t come

i’ma put my everything

put it in a bag

and i’ll be gone

i’m back to the wall

and i’m feeling like

i’m the one pulling the rug

if the times don’t come

i’ma put everything

in the bag

and i’ll be gone

back to the wall

i’m feeling like

i’m the one whose pulling the rug

n+ggers feeling like

he’s back for me

yack, oh, he’s back for me

a stave, a bar

f+ck with me boy

come on

[verse 2]

spit that sh+t in my ear like

y’all motherf+ckers

ain’t ready for this sh+t

i’m down with the ammo

and i’m going in this sh+t

stick with this sh+t

that you know motherf+cker

the same repetition

of the words that you know

cos you’re stuck in the rut

of the same f+cking world

why are you bickering

they are paroling

call that sh+t

a rowing with the current

you’re f+cked in hole

and i’m stuck with the work

cos i can’t pace around this f+cking line

like i am on the sp+ce boy

sp+ce boy

can you help me out

f+ck around, hanging my dead body

with the simple things

yeah
