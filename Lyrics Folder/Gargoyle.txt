[ intro ]

i can’t hear them

i can

lose a girl

on my watch

it’s her . . . probably a way out

pulling on my strings

i call a lease out

me and my mind

we’re on our way out

[verse 1]

hurdling lest it cut suddenly

i spit mandarin inure acrophonic

missing like it’s pleasure

i’m twisted with this torture

me and anne listen

shinto breathing on ma manteau

darker thoughts than biretta

polished shoes for december

this is genitalia all out

fingering for some clout

scrawny hunk on some cash

d+mn, am far out

oa, life after life

writ large, soi+disant

(muckamuck)

botched up brain

had it away

weed through lungs

taper off

bleeding heart

shot it away

what is love

what is love

had to ask twicе

hit that girl no shelf price

i was like what’s that

[bridge]

somеthing’s not right in my cup

i don’t feel right

all my odds haughty, haughty, yo

my girl’s lost

oh

yeah you lost oh

that she lost oh

yeah you lost oh

yes she lost oh

yeah you lost oh

that she lost oh

yeah you lost oh

that she lost oh


[chorus]

feels likes i can’t get my dance right

capricious ass on a night out

adze set to the shards of my past life

feels like i can’t get my dance right

capricious ass on a night out

adze set to the shards of my past life


[outro]

hold up!

woke up feeling like a dilly handed with milli

expensive by her sash

why you blame it on the
