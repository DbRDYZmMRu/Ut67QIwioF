[verse 1]

rolling in my bed

having rollie dreams

can’t get you out of my head

i’ve been f+cking . . . i’ve been thinking about you

i swear, i’ve been f+cking thinking about you

i’ve been having rollie dreams

i’ve been rolling in my bed

i can’t get you out of my head

i’ve been f+cking thinking about you

i swear i’ve been f+cking thinking about you

it’s 4, 5. 10 a.m

i’m still stuck in my head

having f+cking lucid dreams

you gotta tell me what you need

girl i am ready just to serve you

i swear on my life it is just for you

i even had to record just to sing for you

now i’m feeling it deep, deep

i swear i am in my feelings girl

i can’t think about anything but you

i can’t think about anything but you

you gotta lеt me know

if i’m the one who is gonna makе us grow

i’ve been down, down

now i am headed to the top

but i’m still at the ceiling

i swear we can start again

yeah, from the heart again

all i ever wanted was your love

all you ever wanted was my touch

like the midas touch

i’ma get golden

when i spit on the mic

yeah, it is proven

yeah, you’re the one for me

take it slow

don’t ever get it twisted

like the love we had

talk thrash but you know . .
