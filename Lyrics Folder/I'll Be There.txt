[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

tell me now how much i care

tell me how much i fear this failings

i credit on my feignings


[bridge]

i know what goes and what doesn’t ever

i know what pats my love on son

i know how hard it goes

whenever you’re alone


[chorus]

i count the days i’ll be there

i mean the days i hold on

and i call your father in

and i couldn’t care if i ruined my several win


[verse 2]

i just want you here not back there

how far until the under freezes him in likes

i’m still here, i hear

my grеat effervescеnt idea in europe

do you think more of what i say

how can i get the close

never close just resolve

[bridge]

i know what goes and what doesn’t ever

i know what pats my love on son

i know how hard it goes

whenever you’re alone


[chorus]

i count the days i’ll be there

i mean the days i hold on

and i call your father in

and i couldn’t care if i ruined my several win


[bridge]

i know what goes and what doesn’t ever

i know what pats my love on son

i know how hard it goes

whenever you’re alone


[chorus]

i count the days i’ll be there

i mean the days i hold on

and i call your father in

and i couldn’t care if i ruined my several win
