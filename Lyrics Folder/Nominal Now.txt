[intro]

every time, i think i’m burrowing on the wrong john

whenever i think i’m polling on the wrong rock


[verse 1]

i get this thing in my head

i get this vibe when i’m by my bed

i take things for granted

my mind’s on everything right?

i ask

i get it every time

i pace, i try to sort it out

a never, never wraith, it’s all to you

you make . . . missing my point of view

would i ever get in another clue?

do i?

two, i . . . make it out?

lying opposite, never, never?

do i make it out with my b+lls under?

do i make it out?

am i on thеre where you arе?

i’m there wherever you call your home


[verse 2]

two times now, one girl, one horror down

two times, doesn’t count when that shawty came

[chorus]

pain, nominal now

weighing up, discuss the train, nodding my ten

not on my attempt

do i fill there where you are?


[chorus]

pain, nominal now

weighing up, discuss the train, nodding my ten

not on my attempt

do i fill there where you are?


[outro]

something like that you know
