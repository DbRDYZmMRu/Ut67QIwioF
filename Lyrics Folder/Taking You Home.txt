[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

i should be taking you home

and she knows it

she’s saying when will i come around

take her home

let me know her parents, she says


[verse 1]

pretty girl, duty girl

high you curve

winter’s frozen shoes on me

i don’t know

you got me dancing better than i ever did girl

speed it up, wrap it over me gush

shovel sugar

having me call your shoulder

cuddler, wanna make her my land annul

all night long we gon’ make love to your songs

i could put you on, just my own superstar


[outro]

i should be taking you home and she knows it

she’s saying whеn will i come around

take her homе

let me know her parents, she says

she’s saying when will i come around

take her home

let me know her parents, she says
