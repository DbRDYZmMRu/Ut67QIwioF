[intro]

feelings get to me

i will, i say i’ll tell her


[verse 1]

my heart has been beating for a while now

my drive has been acting all spirally now

and i try to tell you how i feel

but i mess it up every time

and i land up on my hills


[bridge]

back to the same spot

cover, leaning in my hurt

am i enough


[chorus]

if i ever say i feel

it might be with this zeal

if i ever say i will

girl i’ll try

if i ever say i feel

best believe it is true

the truth, it’s the true


[verse 2]

i’m through with all of the hurt of the past

moving on with this moving

i ain’t left, i’m in my yearns

it is just goodness flowing out of my heart

and my drive feels like thеre is nothing hanging on

not the tears

not today

not thе veil

i see it clearly

and i’m waking to mine

[chorus]

if i ever say i feel

(if i ever say)

it might be with this zeal

if i ever say i will

(if i ever say, girl best believe i mean it)

girl i’ll try

if i ever say i feel

(if i ever say)

best believe it is true

(if i ever say)

the truth, it’s the true

(best believe i love you)
