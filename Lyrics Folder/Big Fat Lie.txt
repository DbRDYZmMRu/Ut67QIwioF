i really love you

and dammit

i make mistakes

and i am always all over the place

and i never say hi

i never text but really i do

and i hope i can make you know somehow

i just gotta let it go

this won’t be the last draw

i just gotta let it go

pick one more ball

a lie will do


[verse 1]

being in the back and trying to pretend

don’t fuss, a loud cry

she said to me
