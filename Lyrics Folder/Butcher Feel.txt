[intro]

fresh boy chilling

hmm hmmm

girl you know

haters, it feels like words in there; their home

someday another super bowl

letter won my girl back

butcher feel


[chorus]

i don’t really know how to say that i’m still here

if i don’t win this way

i don’t really know how to say here

d+mn, i’m still

if i don’t win this way


[verse 1]

‘cause, money on my mind that’s what matters

winning on time, that’s what’s happening

n+ggers in my crib, they be acting wild

under some stash up

your brush, come looking like a mosh

you’re one of them workaholics

onto y’all, low wrist heinous

all new on returning

me and my crew, we be acting like you’rе talking ball

they don’t wanna see your call

we’re on glutton

our sovеreign in time is to get you done

until we fall by your six, that’s a b+tt of fun

always on my eve, that’s soul son

whose f+cking zone, on whose flag he is on

[chorus]

i don’t really know how to say that i’m still here

if i don’t win this way

i don’t really know how to say here

d+mn, i’m still

if i don’t win this way


[chorus]

i don’t really know how to say that i’m still here

if i don’t win this way

i don’t really know how to say here

d+mn, i’m still

if i don’t win this way
