[bas m nt jaxx: intro]

Hold up

You know i wish you’d make your mind up

Cuz when we get it on, you’re so so (so so)

You used to be my romeo. (woa oh ay oh)

Cuz you see my dear, i have, had enough

Of keeping quiet about all this stuff

You’re neurotic like a yo yo

You used to be my romeo (woa oh ya oh)

Let it all go

[verse 1]

Take me back to the time

All i wanted was some time

To our loss, we’ll sail the sound

Now all i see is

You are lurching me

It’s just to feel real

That i want you closer

Does it . . .

That i will get you closer

Closer than i ever thought

[chorus]

Jail you i eh?

Pick her ass, he’ll never win

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Was it ever, are you ever real

Does he ever reel alone

[bas m nt jaxx: pre chorus]

Hold up

You know i wish you’d make your mind up

Hold up

You know i wish you’d make your mind up

[chorus]

Jail you i eh?

Pick her ass, he’ll never win

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Was it ever, are you ever real

Does he ever reel alone

[chorus]

Jail you i eh?

Pick her ass, he’ll never win

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Jail you, hey you hay

Pay your ass, he never will

Was it ever, are you ever real

Does he ever reel alone

[refrain]

Jail you i eh?

[refrain]

Jail you i eh?

[refrain]

Jail you i eh?

[bas m nt jaxx: outro]

I have, had enough

Of keeping quiet about all this stuff

You’re neurotic like a yo yo, (yo yo)

You used to be my romeo (woa oh ya oh)
