[verse 1]

sipping, out it’s stormy

with the right taste for your summit

when you text

i just want you on my bed

well, i ever care

that i can’t be your dear

lover

(teh who)

can i be your dear lover

(lover)

well in on my thoughts

it bothers

(bothering me)

if we’re on the third

well they’re in love, blah, lover

(i just want your touch)

and i’m trying to reach really closer

so how you piece this spot like the other

ma ah ah ah

beating my collar phase
