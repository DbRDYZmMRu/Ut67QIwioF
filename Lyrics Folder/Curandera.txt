[intro]

how about it?

do i offer you in here?

how i feel the same

can’t tell?


[verse 1]

leaving in prada

i have another

couple therapy is over

i know

my love doesn’t cover it

i’m linked to the peverse

i dream of you all the time

part of something as long as me being pious

i hope that you will change to something better

i dole my mind like a tether

while sipping on his soul ride on kelvin


[bridge]

i’m never caving in

no, not on my l+st

all my laws feels the same

i don’t go thеre

i don’t go buried

[verse 2]

it is still the samе

sucking all the sieved

on my name

leaving: they will say

crystal way

turkey, now i’m on fast

peeling my bane

i’m not napping unto seeing you

señor

i don’t think i ever see you

you paint the town

something like be you

meaning for all we are living

on tee ball


[outro]

the soul c+nt

like the salt i bathe in

the thief in all these case

i’ve been navy on this help

i’ve been taking this sip

like it’s not the weight

i have been giving my neck

all these pain now

hey!

gawd
