[intro]

Hmm, this song is about two females

Probably both singers

[chorus]

She’s acting out

In your stead

She’s screaming loud

In my head

She’s acting out

In your stead

She’s screaming loud

In my head

[bridge]

I can’t live with this

I’ma let it go

I’ma let it slide away

She bought in

Ain’t it?

She holding it all in

I know she fought in

[verse 1]

Etch it out in stone

Tell me now that it is gone

Fickle all fun

Sort it out

Just to call you the one

Nil it all

Nil it all

I was the dill all along

Nil it all

Nil it all

I was the dill all along

[chorus]

She’s acting out

In your stead

She’s screaming loud

In my head

She’s acting out

In your stead

She’s screaming loud

In my head

[bridge]

I can’t live with this

I’ma let it go

I’ma let it slidе away

She bought in

Ain’t it?

She holding it all in

I know she fought in
