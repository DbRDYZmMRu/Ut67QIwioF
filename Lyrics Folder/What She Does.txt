[intro]

hmm, this song is about two females

probably both singers


[chorus]

she’s acting out

in your stead

she’s screaming loud

in my head

she’s acting out

in your stead

she’s screaming loud

in my head

[bridge]

i can’t live with this

i’ma let it go

i’ma let it slide away

she bought in

ain’t it?

she holding it all in

i know she fought in


[verse 1]

etch it out in stone

tell me now that it is gone

fickle all fun

sort it out

just to call you the one

nil it all

nil it all

i was the dill all along

nil it all

nil it all

i was the dill all along


[chorus]

she’s acting out

in your stead

she’s screaming loud

in my head

she’s acting out

in your stead

she’s screaming loud

in my head

[bridge]

i can’t live with this

i’ma let it go

i’ma let it slidе away

she bought in

ain’t it?

she holding it all in

i know she fought in
