pi in

am i in

am buying

every second of ya

i talk to you

when am feeling like i can’t get it

a page up

means amma start all over

famished when i hold on

yeah

weary for the sears

run me

turn me over

you poor dough

who you kiddin’

you running out

a picture get sent

no no no never

famished

tinny lover

where the love at

why do all that

where the love at now

where the love at

why do all that

where the love at

am famished

weird to run down there

talking to myself

she’ll probably say that

running through my head

i play the xylophone

xylophone

pulse in the vain

got me offended

at the window

always delighted

at the window

my dealer dead

out my phase

that’s a lie detected

pie in

am i in

am buying

pi in

am i in

am buying

every second of ya
