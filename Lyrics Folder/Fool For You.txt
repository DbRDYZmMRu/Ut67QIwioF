[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

i see what you’re doing

trying to get me out

get me outside my comfort zone

(my comfort zone)

how have been pr+ne

sure you throw a bone

and i get another bone

it’s a bonus

i better stick with my honours

saying, i can hold back


[chorus]

got my heart racing

saying i can’t resist

can i resist?

say that i’m not a fool for you

got my heart racing

saying that i can’t resist

(i’m not ready)

oh

am i a fool for you?

it’s a food for thought

(fool for you)

am i better outside my comfort zone

(such a fool for you)

such a fool for you

(not the best in me, not the best in me)

[verse 2]

waking up with a bad back

feeling like i got another

wack attempt of proving myself right

if i hit it in the back twice tonight

i might feel like i got a lap coverеd

but that don’t beat on you

don’t beat on you no


[chorus]

got my heart racing

saying i can’t rеsist

can i resist?

say that i’m not a fool for you

got my heart racing

saying that i can’t resist

(i’m not ready)

oh

am i a fool for you?

it’s a food for thought

(fool for you)

am i better outside my comfort zone

(such a fool for you)

such a fool for you

(not the best in me, not the best in me)

[outro]

waking up with a bad back

waking up with a bad back

feeling like i got another

wack attempt of proving myself right
