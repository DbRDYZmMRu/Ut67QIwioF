[intro]

what matters says i’m here

what does this

heart weave through the pages of this story i’m writing

is it to be loved or to love or are the two flowing


[verse 1]

wake up with a smile on my face

i see myself going out of here

out my head

better be prepared

is how you talk to me

knowing that has gotten me this far


[chorus]

so when this madness i’m so familiar with comes

i’ll say

i’m okay with nothing to wrestle a win

i see it, i see it all of its detail


[verse 2]

be the tale

weekends like this

feel like something to dip in

my feet, i wanna takе a swim on

every soul i know

tells me that i’m bеtter than i can

oh
