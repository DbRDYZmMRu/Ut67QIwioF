[intro]

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

my coffee is dark

it is bitter

these obligations don’t feel they differ

gotta get it right, got to get it right

i say a thousand times

i gotta get it right


[bridge]

this time, i just want to lay it out

how you hold me down, it ain’t fair

but this time, i just gotta let it out

how you holding me down, it ain’t fair


[verse 2]

i want to be like the rest of the boys

tell me who is your favorite toy

does he have a better smile

i never crank it anymore

prattle everywhere

when i take a smile, i’m not in her affair

[bridge 2]

cheating on my heart is how you make it fair

telling me, what is

isn’t it fair to be this close

talking to you every time isn’t this colder

loving you like i

i think i need to be sober

waking up to your face, i need to get bolder


[verse 3]

so i am taking my time to get through with my feelings

knowing my feelings

is it not nut time

want to spend a couple of seconds

trying to fade out


[verse 4]

i’ve not been fair

where i have been

everywhere but there

still, i want you to know


[verse 5]

feeling like for share all the time

do i give her my fair share all the time

listen to my creep

when i see you, i can’t deny

i love her, i love her, i love her

[outro]

ah! it’s feeling like a d+mn contract

like, christ, f+ck!
