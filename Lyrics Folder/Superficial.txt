[chorus]

waking up superficial

it’s official, i’m full of vanity

waking up superficial

it’s official, i’m full of vanity


[verse 1]

and my mind don’t pull at the wish right

and my love don’t say it; you through with tan?

oh+oh, it is official

superficial, i’m filled with vanity

i love a girl but i won’t say

i love her body but i won’t tell

i love her heart but it’s not on dell

i’m not sure what is wrong now

i just feel like i am lost, running on this lie

like up, up, men i need a fat seater

i don’t give a f+ck, fissured set

that’s not right

beam my d+mn phone, i don’t see

curses not right

pour my thoughts on you

something is not right

up

i’ve been up, it’s for a while now

up

something is not right, nor right

[verse 2]

he’s superficial, yes, it is official

i’m on toodle+oo

what i want to say is i don’t miss you

oh no girl, i don’t miss you

i just want you out my heart, it’s official

yeah, i am superficial, i don’t give a f+ck

i don’t give a f+ck, i just want to cry myself to sleep

i don’t want her ass, see thе pretty yeah?

only once? it’s a pity yеah

i just want to cry myself to sleep

but it’s too many thots in my head now

yeah, i see i better lose it

so i top my love on a pudding

yeah, i let her; pretty

i don’t care though

i just did a f+cking front line

in the same place, the same scene

the same problems and the same pain

i don’t really know, what is his problem

if he is seen zany

uh+oh

no i’m not insane, i just feel low


[chorus 2]

it’s official, yeah, i am superficial

alone with your love

if this is love, will she feel the same?

[outro]

it’s official, i’m with your love girl

my way superficial, help dissuade love

no, it is official, i don’t want your love girl

i don’t want your love, comma’s lost, superficial

and i want your body

we should party by objecting

every f+cking time cos i am stuck in the tangle

of i don’t feel, but i don’t want to get caught up

oh men, i’m in a mess

this is like my personal freestyle

yeah, i think i
