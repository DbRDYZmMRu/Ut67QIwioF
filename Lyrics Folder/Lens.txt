[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

it’s s+x on my mind

feeling like it’s a minus

by the degree

i mean, it’s the average net

telling me how you’ve got something bigger

bigger bills

i’ve got the issue with the tissues


[verse 2]

this sort of tie

fighting through the why

i need to get it here, back her, darker

put my lens on me

felling like, i can see it, i can feel it

the less you relate to me

i can never cave my seep in none


[verse 3]

and you should know that

we fall through it

and we had it all

tell me one more time

i feel this way, when the soul come on

[verse 4]

no more on the floor and perceive the varying

can’t pray to history

you should be mine often than that

i need more time from you

i feel that i’m giving it all i have got

telling me, that’s only money on my mind

keeping it up with the whines

giving it too much time to grow

it’s a fake career if you’re the one

i hopped on this train to say i caved

oh what a shame this has to play this way

play this way
