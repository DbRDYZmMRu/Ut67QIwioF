Pop

Song for mariam

Frith hilton

[verse 1]

Forget about our homes

Most cruise . . . close

Don’t play indoor

Don’t wait on me

Pretty ears is all i’m here for

The pay is here

It’s all i am here for

[bridge]

To watch, such

All my veins

Dates are varying

Still by her ounce

Porch, hutch

So her wall to my feelings

Theo, i’m still in your heaven

[chorus]

Can you call for more

Two bottle to a pair

To our pairing

Can you call for more

Plume more to a pair

To our pairing

Tale bloom

[verse 2]

She got a ass that makes you

Think, drink

A day a hey, you’re here

I got a heartbeat that makes me impulsive

Is it impossible

Kites into my lawn

Harvey i’ve had this, it’s on beyond

Kites sail over my lorn

I’ve been authoring this

I’ll slip over, it’s by your cousin
