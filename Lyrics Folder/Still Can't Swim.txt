i never had another one

you were my patootie

and you left before a huddler

now i’m lost with it all

lost in the drench of the words

you were the one

never had another patootie

yeah! so if i took

tell me now if it feels better

now i took a slip

now i feel i earned a dip

whoa baby

she’ll never speak ill

take my love and give it away

she’ll never stay here

take my soul and shred it; the pages

i read your words

they weren’t for me

won’t you keep your lies

i took your worth

and all i feel is a mess away

i couldn’t breathe; your pen

again and the word, are they meant for me?

but you gave warning signs

i’ll just fade away instead

reading, with it, leg in

we got a forever moment

and we lost it

reading, reading, reading

we had her for a moment

but we lost it

uh!

trip, trip

it’s a trip eh!

she get to be

don’t you be there

i won’t hold you back

we all out here

we trying to do some loving

proving, you profane

been out here living

nothing comes bad at me

so are your boys

and you wh0re the girls; says you f+cked

now i chide for it

all the genders

i won’t be acting like i ain’t got pulse

to hold your f+cking . .

it smells out

i ‘on’t really care

its all about it; my sin now
