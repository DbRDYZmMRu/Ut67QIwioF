[intro]

i want that sh+t to be banging

it’s still low


[verse 1]

mauve hidden seed

ah

morphing in scene

oh

take my words

never let then chirr

never let them go

take my love

never letting vore

love letter raw

awake my heart

when it’s far from honour

take my son

call it in

[bridge]

easy son

easy son

easy son

easy son

easy son

easy son

easy son

easy son


[chorus]

all the care

i care

pall your liver

your hold on thing

i care

all the care

i always had you in row
