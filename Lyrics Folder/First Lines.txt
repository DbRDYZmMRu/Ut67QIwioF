[chorus]

if i could i would

any time any day any place

i’ll fall back over myself

wish i accord the first lines

if i could i would

any time any day any place

i’ll fall back over myself

wish i accord the first lines

if i could i would


[verse 1]

i make mistakes

coming up showing the same face

asking like, too afraid

well i’m in too deep

with my feelings acting too fit for it

waking up to the same emotions

how i feel about you

acting up when i feel the rush

i give a sob for the fiend

i feel run to, too long now

get myself back


[outro]

wish i accord the first lines

if i could i would
