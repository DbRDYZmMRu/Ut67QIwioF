[refrain]

every day it’s the thought

everything next to naught

every feeling battle fought

healthy wheel, tattle worth

handle worn, the darker wool


[chorus]

hey ye

awful

what is it enough

do you say

the one

hey ye

breathless

your real pop

i can’t say

[verse 1]

my thoughts borne

take me now

i feel here

nerve w+ll++s

it is breathless

and it goes

and it goes

the baddie share

double doth, the promise

over ears

sometimеs, it’s a climax

it never hurts

so we numb it all


[bridge]

(a singing call)


[refrain]

evеry day it’s the thought

everything next to naught

every feeling battle fought

healthy wheel, tattle worth

handle worn, the darker wool


[chorus]

hey ye

awful

what is it enough

do you say

the one

hey ye

breathless

your real pop

i can’t say

[verse 2]

come on, we shouldn’t let it go

over here, i’ll frock over another

i’m still on the same track

i’m calling a siren

i’m not . . .

oh, we are boring

i’m just going in

roaring again


[bridge]

(a singing call)


[verse 3]

i want to know, if you’re here

does it count

if i can’t be here

and i’m breathless


[refrain]

every day it’s the thought

everything next to naught

every feeling battle fought

healthy wheel, tattle worth

handle worn, the darker wool

[chorus]

hey ye

awful

what is it enough

do you say

the one

hey ye

breathless

your real pop

i can’t say
