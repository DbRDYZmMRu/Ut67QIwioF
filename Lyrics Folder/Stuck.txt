[refrain]

Every day it’s the thought

Everything next to naught

Every feeling battle fought

Healthy wheel, tattle worth

Handle worn, the darker wool

[chorus]

Hey ye

Awful

What is it enough

Do you say

The one

Hey ye

Breathless

Your real pop

I can’t say

[verse 1]

My thoughts borne

Take me now

I feel here

Nerve w ll  s

It is breathless

And it goes

And it goes

The baddie share

Double doth, the promise

Over ears

Sometimеs, it’s a climax

It never hurts

So we numb it all

[bridge]

(a singing call)

[refrain]

Evеry day it’s the thought

Everything next to naught

Every feeling battle fought

Healthy wheel, tattle worth

Handle worn, the darker wool

[chorus]

Hey ye

Awful

What is it enough

Do you say

The one

Hey ye

Breathless

Your real pop

I can’t say

[verse 2]

Come on, we shouldn’t let it go

Over here, i’ll frock over another

I’m still on the same track

I’m calling a siren

I’m not . . .

Oh, we are boring

I’m just going in

Roaring again

[bridge]

(a singing call)

[verse 3]

I want to know, if you’re here

Does it count

If i can’t be here

And i’m breathless

[refrain]

Every day it’s the thought

Everything next to naught

Every feeling battle fought

Healthy wheel, tattle worth

Handle worn, the darker wool

[chorus]

Hey ye

Awful

What is it enough

Do you say

The one

Hey ye

Breathless

Your real pop

I can’t say
