[intro]

you ain’t got no hold over me

you ain’t got

you ain’t got

you ain’t got no hold over me


[chorus]

you ain’t got no hold over me

i was hurting

thought it for nothing

how we ended

had me laden

playing pretend

this will never end

you ain’t got no hold over me

pass the buck

shut me off

forlorn on my own

no shoulders i cried alone

alone alone

[verse 1]

i thought you were something special

something i could hold on to

not to miss a touch i couldn’t shudder to

two weeks down this road

this was over too

i could lie a lie

tell a lie my utter liar

paired into your random pander

whack a mole erosion of falling altitudes

attitude more corrosive than oxy dew

me racking clues courier of bad moods

sip from your aid

backwashed migraine

last sheath had the worst stain

had me wishing on a card game

losing streak what a satire

call me out how high up my umpire

your brash image

ignoring everything

it’s a fight

it’s verbal

it’s a fight

it isn’t fair

what’s a revolver

had everything

now am back to the floor

like i never got sh+t started

it’s a flop

it’s a flew over

it’s a vibe

is it wrong

cos i’m not with the bag; game

i can’t reach myself

music in me and now i

can’t get a hold over me

[chorus]

you ain’t got no hold over me

i was hurting

thought it for nothing

how we ended

had me laden

playing pretend

this will never end

you ain’t got no hold over me

pass the buck

shut me off

forlorn on my own

no shoulders i cried alone

alone alone


[outro]

i just want you here

head here pretty

head here pretty
