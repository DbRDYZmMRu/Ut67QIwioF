[ verse 1 ]

when we first met

i knew that we had it

love grows a spot

it turns into a habit

and i can’t understand it

how our tinder

kindles with all these distance

shiveringly, shiveringly and it’s hot

my heart can’t take this distraught

if remote’s shut off what is it we’ve got

i’m not honest and you’re not here next to me

lover, lover how we play undercover

so far away and it’s got me bothered

loving a license away

your heart is never far just a dial easy

[ chorus: breana marin ]

i’ll be lying

if i said i didn’t miss you baby

cos it is differеnt

when i’m with you baby

you’re the onе i run to

and i can’t help it

i’ll be lying

if i said i didn’t miss you baby

it ain’t easy to be with you baby

you’re the one i need

yeah

you are the one


[ verse 2 ]

are you still the one for me

i can’t get enough of this

all this got me self+conceited

can you perceive this

i want more of this

can you feel the st++zy

riding through the city in my one wheeler

d+mning

hey, entire

everything you need

everything you need

diamond ring

girl you are the

girl you are

[ chorus: breana marin ]

i’ll be lying

if i said i didn’t miss you baby

cos it is different

when i’m with you baby

you’re the one i run to

and i can’t help it

i’ll be lying

if i said i didn’t miss you baby

it ain’t easy to be with you baby

you’re the one i need

yeah

you are the one
