[verse 1]

seen something special lately here

that girl

pat me on the back

tell me that you like it

ah!

pat me on the back

girl i’ll tell you that i like it

oh oh 


[verse 2]

pretty girl with the pretty face

can you come my way

pretty girl with the pretty face

can you tell me how you feel the same

i have been on your radar for a while now

and i have said it so many times

avid i love that face


[verse 3]

pretty girl with the pretty face

can you tell that i’m still here

calling out your name to the sky

pretty girl with the pretty face

can you tell that i’m still here

shouting h+rny to the sky

i’m just in on my first song

okay, i wanna say that i care

[verse 4]

seen a lot of guys

but i know that when i hum here

promise i’m gonna try

to fully show

h+ll my lady

if i still lily sweat

if i still lily swear, you’re here

my legs floating
