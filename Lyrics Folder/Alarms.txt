[intro]

oh oh

fresh boy chilling

oh

at this junction

i ask myself what would be

for you to not be mine


[chorus]

at this junction

i’m asking myself what would be

for you to not be mine

not be mine, not be mine

that’d be disastrous for me

habit down

i’d be down

down the lloyd heart for me

spotlight is on me

that’s just a big lie on me


[verse 1]

waking up this morning

it’s feeling like something is alarming

the water is all over my sheets

so i’ve been washed clean

this feeling from above

got me filtering all my dreams once again

[chorus]

at this junction

i’m asking myself what would be

for you to not be mine

not be mine, not be mine

that’d be disastrous for me

habit down

i’d be down

down the lloyd heart for me

spotlight is on me

that’s just a big lie on me


[verse 2]

waking up this morning

it’s feeling like something is alarming

the water is all over my sheets

so i’ve been washed clean

this feeling from above

got me filtering all my dreams once again


[outro]

oh oh

what here?

what would be here?

what would be here?

what would be here?
