[verse 1]

i think we had something

my thoughts dowel on your hurting

and i can’t take

i’ll take it; the hurt

and i can’t take

i’ll take the hurt

i’ll take the hurt

it’s for the while

i’ll take the hurt

it’s for the while

and i wrestled

pock precise for the broken

i cried then, i cried din

oh, another thing

[chorus]

sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it often

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it often

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae


[verse 2]

my inane thinking

could you hold the th+rn?

bid the need

feel me nearer

could you hold a th+rn?


[chorus]

sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it that often

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love don’t say it that often

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae


[outro]

i’m sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry
