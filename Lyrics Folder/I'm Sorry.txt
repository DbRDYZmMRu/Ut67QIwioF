[verse 1]

I think we had something

My thoughts dowel on your hurting

And i can’t take

I’ll take it; the hurt

And i can’t take

I’ll take the hurt

I’ll take the hurt

It’s for the while

I’ll take the hurt

It’s for the while

And i wrestled

Pock precise for the broken

I cried then, i cried din

Oh, another thing

[chorus]

Sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it often

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

Sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it often

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

[verse 2]

My inane thinking

Could you hold the th rn?

Bid the need

Feel me nearer

Could you hold a th rn?

[chorus]

Sorry, sorry, my love don’t say it that often

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love don’t say it that often

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, my love hurts; sundae

[outro]

I’m sorry, i’m sorry, i’m sorry
