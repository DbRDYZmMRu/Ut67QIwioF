[chorus]

so easy to cut it off

where are you now

that i need you

i ain’t fairing through this distance

she never had it

brick heart just like an addict

break that back for a bag of solid

everything you throw at her she above it

back on my mind

how you do that sh+t

referrals how you move that sh+t

a+lissa, where are you now

i’m out my wits sir

i can’t get you now

[bridge]

trick, trick

out of my l!ck

it’s over a week

i’m on my dimwit

love her in and out the glow


[verse 1]

oh, oh she never lets me

no don’t go

i’m next to you like a partner

your song on the radio

girl, you got me turnt like a rodeo

her l+st in the storm of a b+ttonhole

i’m lost in a b+ttonhole


[chorus]

so еasy to cut it off

where are you now

that i need you

i ain’t fairing through this distancе

she never had it

brick heart just like an addict

break that back for a bag of solid

everything you throw at her she above it

back on my mind

how you do that sh+t

referrals how you move that sh+t

a+lissa, where are you now

i’m out my wits sir

i can’t get you now

[bridge]

trick trick

out of my l!ck

it’s over a week

i’m on my dimwit

love her in and out the glow


[outro]

dreaming, dreaming

dreaming, dreaming

dreaming uh, dreaming

i’m dreaming

i’m dreaming of you

of you

i’m dreaming of you

i’m dreaming of you
