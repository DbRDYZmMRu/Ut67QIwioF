[intro]

it isn’t sweet lullaby

am i ever gonna have a tie

i used to think

i’ll never meet the queen

i used to think

i’ll never be a king


[chorus]

holding my line

not counting on another day

loitering you trite

not wanting another sp+ce


[verse 1]

you’re a fire fighter

coming with a siren

to my disaster

gang arrival

with your molotov c+cktail

you disband my boos

it feels low

whenever i’m making hard

of her effort

it feels whole

whenever her meme

swathing in her ardour

[bridge]

and i can’t break apart on the road

an idler making a run


[chorus]

holding my line

not counting on another day

loitering you tritе

not wanting another sp+ce

holding my line

not counting on anothеr day

loitering you trite

not wanting another sp+ce


[verse 2]

baby, in warming tricksy

my heart how are you sealing

never busy

my favourite

heavy on my insistence

date it, say it’s no mitten

you got me purring

what is it you pondering

pouring, broody burning

i’m purring

what is it you pondering

pouring, broody burning

[chorus]

holding my line

not counting on another day

loitering you trite

not wanting another sp+ce

holding my line

not counting on another day

loitering you trite

not wanting another sp+ce
