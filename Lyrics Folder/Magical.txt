[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

ever ever had it, a girl

have you ever had a best friend

how you ever @ the girl

i got a best friend

i got a girl

she never asks too much

always got my back

and she’s coming for the bark here

i got a girl

she got a best friend

telling everyone

that should be me and not no one

and i’m packing my bag low

when you get offended

ghetto fiend yeah

i’m gawking my bag low

you’ll get your fee

get your fee


[bridge]

yeah, i made hеr my girl

she never turns mе down

she never turned me down

yeah, i got a girl

[chorus]

isn’t it magical

how we’re still in love

isn’t it magical

how you still got my back

how you still got my back

isn’t it magical

how we’re still in love

isn’t it magical

how you still got my back


[verse 2]

i never had time for work girls

i could say

i’d even rhyme it with a note that says

looking like pinocchio

acting like i’m dud to you

girl you should know that

i’m all but the latter to you

and my lies in this

figuring it out

acting it out

telling you

i’mma try and love you real out

saying it with a seared edge
