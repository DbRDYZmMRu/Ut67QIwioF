[intro]

see me moving on

with my sore

see me moving on

weak à la


[verse 1]

my top is on

it say, something like this is fun

had my heart broken

it felt like something i could avoid with a bar

but i tucked it

put it in the back

and now, for her i dream

fighting for what i believe in

could you talk to me

say hi

tell me something you would buy

i feel this sh+t is real

real, real

lay my love for you

like what i would write for you

like something i would sing for you

to hold the town for you

[outro]

could we dance over a pretty moon

could we take a trial on the already doomed

oh, it says something that is just . . .

most sounds like

oh girl, you arе the fancy i live for

my heroinе, my forward heaven

my fantasy
