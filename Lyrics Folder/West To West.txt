[verse 1]

i greased the windows of heaven’s walls

so let all springs just shower free

from our heart in where we act

seek perfection for the helpless path

if that’s all we can give them

it will only show how much we care

from all around in our world


[verse 2]

make this love we have be still

tomorrow changes not

make this love we have remain

from “west to west” for everyone


[verse 3]

i greased the windows of heaven’s walls

so let all springs just shower free

from all around in our world

make this love we have be still, remain

from “west to west” for everyone
