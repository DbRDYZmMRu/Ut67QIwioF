[verse 1]

autochthons, it is just you and i

in this camo phase

see who never had a face

l+stre, your eroding ocean

leave a little rain

sun foment before my wake

i arrived

topmost floor heard your aubade

in the acme lot held your reel vine

holding me

carrying me away

[verse 2]

see me leaving it

on top au fait

she’s my sleigh in here

i have her on top fair

my palomino

her flaw on top tier

jut misfeasance

my bandwagon cheer

i got the da dada dada da

she remembers me like a leaf

never rut you

i got the da dada dada da

holding her jackanapes

chum

together ashlar
