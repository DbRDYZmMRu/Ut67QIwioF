[intro]

fresh boy chilling

billie jean is not my lover

billie jean is not my lover

she’s got to go

she’s got to go

billie jean is not my lover


[verse 1]

i wake up in the morning

and i take a selfie

the sun is at the back

and a bird is smiling

i don’t hear voices

i think it’s boring

it’s boring

back in the ghetto

d+mn, i had so much fun

all the ladies screaming

like where is the fun

d+mn, the males they be hanging

where it’s wrong

i be acting like i don’t gift

i’m just fronting


[verse 2]

money on my mind

i don’t give a f+ck

it’s my life

and i write hеre

they acting like thеy know what it’s about

i say they’re just fumbling

winnow, get it off

i say, no! it’s my turf

walking with my legs

like it’s for fun

even on a holiday

i go for my walks

d+mn, i love it

i can’t deny it

bet this saying falls right to lorn

now i’m feeling like i got a million pounds

who would fuss

gonna get me out of this mood

not you, not me

not anybody who’s about my stacks

yeah, we got it right

not you, not me

not anybody say who’s about their racks

tryna get it up

[verse 3]

i am with the club

i am with the rub

you can rob my heart

i can never take it back

i am about the store

yeah, i put it in my nose if it is fresh

and i take no least

i’m just hanging with the best rush

(billie jean is not my lover)

she’s holy, wants to put it in my inbox

(billie jean is not my lover)

i told her, it is no love

that’s my girl
