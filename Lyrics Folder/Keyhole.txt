[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

peeping through the keyhole

i see this hope

peeping through the keyhole

i see this hope


[verse 1]

this throw appeasing you

this growth attaining is on your heart

kilter, higher wits lather

feigning this hurt

when i know the taste

i’ll feel better

when i got my lense on, i see you

a quarter mile away with another faded heart

asking questions about a book with a missing page

had to fit your roles girl

does it ever change juror pace

losing my oath now

won’t solve a fading waning mining my likes

isn’t it fair day enough for your fore hides

for your number i gеt the knives

[verse 2]

you got my love so frayеd

with your heart, does it give the headaches

oh wield the lantern, will i ever see through thee

oh with the pulse will i see another face

oh with your heart will i feel close to finally saved

feeling better, got a plee deal for myself

tomb bill, you’re p+b+rty so for forever
