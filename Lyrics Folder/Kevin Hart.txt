[intro]

it’s just this evening

i felt i was living

in the present, but like

like i had seen the future sometime

and everything just felt you know

quite retro


[chorus]

bringing love back

(hey)

bringing heart back

(hey)

when you’re in

forever marching on

bringing love back

(hey)

bringing hearts back

(hey)

i’m forever

where i’m marching on

beating in my heart

has a different theme

can you let it go

beating in my heart

has a different rhythm

can you let it go

[verse 1]

the smile on my face can’t deny it

(i kind of like it, you know, i mean it’s different)

the block on your face i can buy it

it’s just how i see it

taking my mind and i say it twice

just to believe it

i am not withholding this


[verse 2]

not withholding

i am betrothing

(hey)

say it

that she’ll never get the hold of me

(hey, hey)

i quill it

every time i swindle these feelings

that wanna keep me in check

k!ll me

(hey)

i dribble it

(hey)

see my caving heart

does he ever feel you’re in lead

pee, your ending

then you diss the will

[outro]

yeah, yeah, yeah

cut it out

i, kevin hart

does he ever

carve it out

as i hang up paying . . .

he earns
