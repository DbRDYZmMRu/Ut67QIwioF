[intro]

fair this time

end design

when i rewind

i can’t decide


[chorus]

i don’t really care no more

i think it is fair this time

i don’t really care this time

it’s always been this fair

her mind to wake

i can’t tell for fair

oil a lamp, i might get it

i do all the time

oh you’re my girl

does it help

break the cell

as long as i am


[verse 1]

fascination, that’s your impression

i die, i die

fascination, that’s your station

i die, die

all the time, die, why

all the time, bye

[chorus]

i don’t really care no more

i think it is fair this time

(oh die, i do)

i don’t really carе this time

it’s always been this fair

(oh die, i do)

her mind to wakе

(wake)

i can’t tell for fair

(fair)

oil a lamp, i might get it

i do all the time

(i do all the time)

oh you’re my girl

does it help

break the cell

as long as i am


[verse 2]

flesh, i am ready here

fetch, it’s all i do

flair, it is my heart broken

we should end it, end it

oh+oh oh+oh+oh+oh

end it, end it

oh+oh oh

[chorus]

i don’t really care no more

i think it is fair this time

i don’t really care this time

it’s always been this fair

her mind to wake

i can’t tell for fair

oil a lamp, i might get it

i do all the time

oh you’re my girl

does it help

break the cell

as long as i am
