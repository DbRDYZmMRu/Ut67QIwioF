[intro]

fresh boy chilling

when you come around

it’s above in the air

marks of celebration is up in the air


[verse 1]

whining now

oh oh

she’s got a panic now

oh oh

and i don’t know how to quiet it down

how do i slake what you desire

love in your eyes not going out

not on my watch

down for you i’m your soldier

down for you i’m your bartender

let me get you what you want

oh oh

how could it ever die

when i’m by her

how could it ever fly

her ever being alone

daughter of her mother

brother like no other

just gotta love her fiery eyes

she makes you never wanna break ties

she’s got me in her heart

with her soddened bothers

[outro]

you ain’t gotta bother

still here televising

be there, under my shirt
