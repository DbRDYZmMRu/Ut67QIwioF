[chorus]

she’ll never know how the story goes

neckpiece for a cuddle yo

paint me with a crayon

leave me for the patio

she’ll never know how the story goes

neckpiece for a cuddle yo

paint me with a crayon

leave me for the patio

party ho


[verse 1]

she got me so messed up

i’ve been drinking

i can’t get enough

listless, i’ve been losing my vision

shut off!

isn’t it tough love?

on a sunday

i’ll be a stowaway onto the next day

like drawings madе of stencils

got me stuck on her shoеs

like which do i choose

i can’t get it right

feels like i just popped a xanax

while i am stuck pondering why i am nervous

still lost in my task

above, is how i accost lover

trimming the silver lining

sheaving my eve finales

[bridge]

i’m not my own

when you got that grip on me

i’m not my own

i’m not my own

when you got that grip on me

i’m not my own


[chorus]

she’ll never know how the story goes

neckpiece for a cuddle yo

paint me with a crayon

leave me for the patio

party ho

she’ll never know how the story goes

neckpiece for a cuddle yo

paint me with a crayon

leave me for the patio

party ho
