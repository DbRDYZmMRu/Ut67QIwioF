[intro]

hey, tell me


[verse 1]

how many times does it take

to call a girl a cheater

because i’ve spent so many nights

tryna beat you at it

how many times does it count for a girl

a cheetah

because i’ve tried so many nights now

to hold it down

that girl is my girl

(my girl)

she could be, she could be, she could be

a runaway

i’m on my prayer


[chorus]

talk to me like you don’t know about it

talk to me, there’s a side of it

talk to me i’ll be fine

please tell me that it is still fine

talk to me all about it

talk to me girl you are mine forever

[verse 2]

i’m too sick of this

i’m too bad at this

i should have my cooler girls betting this

i don’t want forever

we could just act like

we’re your influence, eh?

girl, don’t you see

my heart, it never flees from your side

my heart it’s on a goodbye

i’m losing my self, losing my mind

yes, a tidbit of this rhyme

i’m losing my heart

how many times does it count to hold it down


[chorus]

you talk to me like you don’t know about it

talk to me, there’s a side of it

talk to me i’ll be fine

please tell me that it is still fine

talk to me all about it

talk to me

girl you are mine forever


[verse 3]

i’m too sick of this

i’m too bad at this

i should have my cooler girls betting this

i don’t want forever

we could just act like

we’re your influence, eh

girl, don’t you see

my heart, it never flees from your side

my heart it’s on a goodbye

[outro]

i’m losing my self, losing my mind

yes, a tidbit of this rhyme
