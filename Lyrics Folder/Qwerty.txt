[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you


[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you

[verse 1]

girl i’m sure stoked, in

is it how you walked in

your gait got me a mile away

period after period pondering

how terse and schlub

cos you’re not

clutch in cuff of your words

can’t get enough of your love

in the throes of your touch


[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you


[bridge]

eddying it’s heavy

buried, got me stuck

yeah it’s hollow

ambrosia that’s your love

i ‘on’t feel no sorrow

i ‘on’t feel no sorrow

you might also like

[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you


[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you


[verse 2]

seems that imbued with the latent

i’m on dodgy

castle love won’t you save me from this souterrain

loving remote is enough when the qwerty works

i get enough when your words hit me on the spot

it’s so trite don’t leave me expletive

sober, home, i don’t ever leave my lair

tacit when we loll there’s no waiver

nothing better

running in circles

our weather

[bridge]

eddying it’s heavy

buried, got me stuck

yeah it’s hollow

ambrosia that’s your love

i ‘on’t feel no sorrow

i ‘on’t feel no sorrow


[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you


[chorus]

running in circles

can’t get enough letters

to tell you how i feel

i’ma throw the qwerty away

i can’t get to you
