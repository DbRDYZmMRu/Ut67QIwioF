[intro]

and i get a quarter, a payday

[verse 1]

it is slim grate

with my f+cking lady

i don’t ever say it

i just pace and paste it

how many? have a taste

feels like something

i can’t get a phase off

i’ma just give a pickle weather

take a whole

holding out

nasty, quilts top sh+t

i’m not slovenly, i’m just cuddling

i’m just a sovereign, a lean

am i overly holding all my thoughts

[chorus]

i pray

when it sink it down

i pray

hollers in the rear

when you look up in it

i pray

i can’t get enough, i see it

i pray

suckling in the sum reign

sweating money getter

you can’t get it right

oh+ah+ah

we paid to get in

(laughter)


[verse 2]

hey

figure it out like a stove in

i’m not even reporting

i just take her, no recording it

i’m just solving it, like eden, ain’t it

i’m not even a fed head

it is just loving on her kid head

oh my vid set, had to take it on her plinth

to the back

told her i was not even for the ride ache

swimming pool leg

no gravity

(yeah)

all these bridals on me

take a fake, do defending

oh sh+t, they ain’t your man

(i’m not even your man)

i say over and over

she gotta l!ck it like tuba in her

i’m serving her water, i l!ck

this ain’t over, we audited

(laughter)
