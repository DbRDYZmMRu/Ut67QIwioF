[intro]

i’m on the come up

voices in my head

fresh boy chilling

they don’t let me be

i don’t even feel real


[verse 1]

i don’t feel real

not on this one

i don’t feel real

not a worry running in my mind

sometimes i sound too young

sometimes i feel

d+mn, i’m way too young

but this is not a time for growing up

this is time for putting bag of b+lls

when i put my socks on

and i know i got that

oh leave them

dad stored the diaper

that’s the kind of thing that made me figure

wait, i gotta act

and i’m not with this pad

don’t @ me boy

and i’m tryna get this sh+t

like it’s grammy girls

and they say they heard it

i’m about it

true l!cker, shove with that

kid won, like he bridged your heart

i’m not down for your vibe

i’m not down like it’s a crime

i’m not down you can whine

i’m about that realer fly

[verse 2]

who has my tracks? that’s a regular

that girl told me

she could be while she whiling

i’m looking for another time

dad’s passing

that’s not me, no mummy

i’m not the parson

that’s not the pyramid

i swear, it’s not adding

i’m just tryna get it out of me

need the half writ

like oh gawd

i’m tryna get this coded out

i’m gonna get these fillers out

like it’s now or rid


[verse 3]

while i’m on my own

i need to trail a rabbit

like try and get it like

i’m hot, cooking rabid

but no time for diss

i have to go with this

put it out, like i’m tryna corrupt this

leak it out, freak it out

no i mean, i’m reading out

i’m chilling, domino

now it’s the seeking out

i’m tryna fake it out

i’m tryna seek it out

this was their mission to me

d+mn i think i get it off

on the wrong share

i don’t ever hear no one

who speaks like me around

and that’s not making me proud

or helping me, or tryna make me

i can go in one round

men, i’mma f+cking rob us

like he his dub ish

link in, like i try to get it

from the outer ovary ish

hush? sh+t

they say i amount to oilish

i’m tryna get the goal

he’s not with your habit
