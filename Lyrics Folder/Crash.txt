[intro]

let’s go on this

(clears throat)

whoa


[verse 1]

i don’t know why i don’t know

sometimes it feels that i got it right

and i got it right now

sometimes it feels that i can’t get it right

and i can’t get it right

girl you got me feeling like

i can’t get it right

i’ve been stuck on your words

i can’t get it right

i can’t read through these lines

what i’ve got wrong

what i got funds

what i got phony

my heart and soul

f+cking lost

i be taut in

i be coming with this other sh+t

i wrote too many words

now i am caught up in the rudder l+st

whoa, l+st sheet

i woke up on the wrong sheet this morning

i don’t know

i ‘on’t feel like

d+mn, i be in the zone

the sh+t be holding me down

and i can’t spit it out

got me feeling like

d+mn, i don’t want to get out

whoa, whoa, you should be my girl

my valentine love

give mе that love

f+cking give me that lovе

have me feeling one like

you never had much

i don’t want it

i don’t f+cking want it

when you tell me you love me

feels like i am on it

and i’m back in the city

and i’m all do

[verse 2]

got the wrong sh+t

not it feels that i am

back to this sh+t

i was trapped in these sheets

now i’m caught up in this b+tch

like this is what it is

and these people are trying to k!ll me

they’re tryna have me drowned

in these f+cking hate vibes

but i just sieve it out

had to put a f+cking crash

in f+cking l.a

just to solve it out

like scheme around

porting now

like i was something about

motherf+ckers

and i don’t f+ck with that sh+t

putting my soul like
