[intro]

hmm, hey


[verse 1]

do i ever pick on fate

do i ever say i know my fate

i keep holding on

begging isn’t it the last day

fay, answer i have been on my way

i can’t take it out this day

but i know that everything is out my way

would i take this the right way

she’s my lover sending hers overt

chase my love, does it never arrive


[verse 2]

past the station

feeling like i got no occupation

all i ever do

well, i ever do is mention

that i’m on my way

right here, right here on my way

said i’ve been on my way

right here, right here on my way

where it’s ever felt the same

all the love in my face

it’s her

[bridge]

who’ll never get enough


[verse 3]

he’s dead in the way of our l+st

i’m core on the diet in your own words

cuddled up in your love

don’t you take it back

i can’t stand away

stand away
