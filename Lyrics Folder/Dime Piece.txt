[intro]

fresh boy chilling

stay and see what becomes of what froze up

flow is up


[verse 1]

do you mind to

flay these emotions

see if it fickle

when i’m leveling up

saying how i get it done

i get a little bit zed with my ten


[bridge]

counting how many down

is it nine or ten

lover, wonder


[chorus]

nada

i’ll be heading, neat my hair

ramming affair, running over

nada, cos she’s a dime piece

i will need a million fingers

just to hold this one down

dime piece, i think i might be caught up

[verse 3]

too much on my plate

wishing i was late to the table

d+mn, i better not put a curse on my baby

my parеnts be hoping for the best

oh on mе, i pray i get my dime piece


[bridge]

counting how many down

is it nine or ten

lover, wonder


[chorus]

nada

i’ll be heading, neat my hair

ramming affair, running over

nada, cos she’s a dime piece

i will need a million fingers

just to hold this one down

dime piece, i think i might be caught up


[outro]

girls rerun through this yard

like it’s a class

all the time

they’re minding that final clash

it’s me, i get all as

the lecturer has blessed me
