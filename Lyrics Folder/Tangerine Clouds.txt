[chorus]

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me

tangerine clouds

perfect high

when you’re next to me

so+sorry i’m not home

silhouette heart

when you’re not next to me

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me

[verse 1]

this hour can’t seem to tick off weeks sour

pictures gliding through the phone

pieces of your kaleidoscope heart

make a man stand out


[bridge]

streak in hеre

brief in herе

it’s how you tell that you’re alive

eve you’re fun

i can’t let it go

your cradle gets me honey

no better one

your cradle gets me honey

don’t leave me with a crone


[chorus]

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me

tangerine clouds

perfect high

when you’re next to me

so+sorry i’m not home

silhouette heart

when you’re not next to me

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me

[verse 2]

so, pleasing your touching

is it my burden

i can’t love no one harder

tell me we’re celebrating


[bridge]

streak in here

brief in here

it’s how you tell that you’re alive

eve you’re fun

i can’t let it go

your cradle gets me honey

no better one

your cradle gets me honey

don’t leave me with a crone


[chorus]

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me

tangerine clouds

perfect high

when you’re next to me

so+sorry i’m not home

silhouette heart

when you’re not next to me

be my wife

ocean drive

when you’re next to me
