[intro]

ticking out everything that could go wrong

probably depart the heed with a hunch in crunch

peeling, no saying with a peeve we saw

high key, the beads are on her


[verse 1]

ruling the roost

never took a boost

i’ve just went for the goose

and i put my love where you will never choose

don’t you know this guy he’s nothing to prove

i’m lost in my brain

that’s another crew

oh girl she knows it

i never say it

there is enough of it

big in dowse

that’s a cricket

big on ignoring my phone

how do you say in love . . .

i say bigger habit

this is big as your heart has been

hit it in the back

acting like a tour of it

hands, you are sh+tting

been a man, you’re kid in

around, get this chief

i’m big dead over it

couldn’t have a survey

how your care above it

oh girl, it is your day, you disturb

we should take this sub

[verse 2]

it is not my fault

essay on amor fati

i never farted

had to spark some advice in your gules honest

and she know

i never pick calls from west dolls

cos you are now the graph

isn’t it the girl wussing out in another voyeur

feeling like an infant when i lose my fawn

and i know who is cupid

and i coil in this

stop, you are a bairn

if we never had it

till the formal we are headed

like twice, now we are friends

sorry, i never had . . .

it is the clung that we never had

like a bond that was real from the very hands

of this liken

everything that makes his part in vain
