[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

starting off the session

with how much i like your smile

your legs seem like they are walking up to my bedside

(and they’re outlaws in a standoff film)

and when you talk

oh how your lips so pin


[chorus]

can i savour this moment

be a brute

carefree, live in fulfilment

can i savour this moment

be a brute

carefree, living in fulfilment


[bridge]

starting from a shadow of your face in panorama

can i do it?

save my conscience 


[verse 2]

life is obviously a runway

and they save you

every single time

with your legs walking to a mic

oh, i can’t invite it

i’m decided

i’m down with your void

echoing i’ve found you

so i know how it hurts

[chorus]

can i savour this moment

be a brute

carefree, live in fulfilment

can i savour this moment

be a brute

carefree, living in fulfilment


[bridge]

starting from a shadow of your face in panorama

can i do it?

save my conscience 


[bridge]

starting from a shadow of your face in panorama

can i do it?

save my conscience
