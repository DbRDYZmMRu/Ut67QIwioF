[verse 1]

i found a chick

it was looking so good

it was hot

i ain’t the boy

i just had to put somе on

so i put her on my mind

and i say a pup will cry tonight

and i made it do it

cos i get the telepathy crane sh+t

chicken no dey cry for night though

if it ever does

i’ma cut it fetter, let it blown

yeah
