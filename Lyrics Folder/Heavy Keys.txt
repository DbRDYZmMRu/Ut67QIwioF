[verse 1]

yeah

too cliché

this is the last chance

to be something different

i miss my friends but

i’m paid through paypal

motherf+cker this is my credit card

you could call me back if you need distance

i promise this is not the hour

emma x on me chest

and i’m going for the best yeah

i’m always gunning

but i’m never gonna bother

cos all these n+ggers know

he is never about the others

it is just about the money

parked up in my corners

and n+ggers still tryna count

the f+cking commas

i was f+cking on the tv

for wanted while i was stuck

now all n+ggers tryna hold me back

i say that’s rigid, stop

i’m in a f+cking distend

of the deep perm

[verse 2]

yeah, yeah

i still say sh+t

i stick to my heavy keys

back to the park

cos i never say odd

all these n+ggers tryna put me

in the f+cking spot

but i don’t go there

it is the f+cking monologue

i don’t give a f+ck about what they say

i’ll be spitting this sh+t

cos i don’t hear the sane

i only mind my own f+cking d+mn business

n+ggers tryna call me up

that’s a severance

i sever all f+cking ties

except for love

now these n+ggers got me feeling like

this is all for the money

for the plough, say what

okay back

back . . .

(who taught you first pouf)

. . . to the one i . . . nuff
