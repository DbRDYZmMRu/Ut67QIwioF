[intro]

woah oh+oh

would you say you are gold


[verse 1]

i can’t take my love away

it doesn’t count when you say no

i can’t take my love away

it doesn’t count when you say no

beaver touch

here with you

you really here, right?

believe your love

when you hold me tight

[chorus]

my telling

would be alright, loving

unless i won’t be there

it is rehab


[verse 2]

some say my intentions could be a crime

some say my time don’t rhyme alright

and i don’t really know if it’s a real kite

but i am floating to you

i just need summer gad

how we roll

how we spеak

doesn’t ever say vеtting, vetting vetted

ah!

how we go really slow when we dance
