[intro]

pain on me

paying only you

it’s pain on the mortal

pain on the whirl

a mole, a little add+on

modding my nerve in


[verse 1]

attraction will cost you

pardon if i say it again

my heart robe don’t swathe

fanning to my loss

growing heat

in the turf under her love

frozen pole with a burning heart

animal for peace with the city

beauty on her for the disparity

say it’s the animosity

before i go; clear my cache

get the winding up and start again

[bridge]

how we roll, every vroom

every lap remaining

alley in tow

lilo float

who is letting bane


[chorus]

pain on me

paying only you

it’s pain on the mortal

it’s pain on the whirl


[verse 2]

i don’t really get it these days

i feel like i’m turning another pain this phase

doesn’t matter what i say; this heinous

i’m still locking my vein away

make it what i do cause it this bleak

in a lodging crease, along comes the mischief


[bridge 2]

how we roll, every vroom

every lap remaining

alley in tow

lilo float

who is letting bane

who is letting bane

ever not wrong

ever not home

[verse 3]

no brainer, you soup the pain

have your little toms all ready

beating on my heart

they will never love again

heaven won’t let my heart in

i’m not in for the numbing

who do you lie to

mood to tell

beauty on her for the disparity

say it’s the animosity

before i go; clear my cache

get the winding up and start again


[bridge]

how we roll, every vroom

every lap remaining

alley in tow

lilo float

who is letting bane


[chorus]

pain on me

paying only you

it’s pain on the mortal

it’s pain on the whirl
