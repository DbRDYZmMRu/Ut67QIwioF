[intro]

it’s a bad habit

looking down

it’s a bad habit


[verse 1]

i don’t want her love

i don’t want her touch

child is what i’m lobbying

i’ll be tryna lure the dub

i don’t want her sob

i don’t want her tour

i just want her loving coming out from the top

is it enough?

is it enough?

looking for something that bites from the top

is it enough?

is it enough?

looking for something that bites with a notch

and i’m down

guess i’m putting down

with the love

if she down

if she ain’t f+cking down with the love

and i bounce

if you aren’t f+cking down with the love

and it bounce

and it bounce

and it switches like a drum

and i’m hanging with the crew

and they never had a ride

looking that

it’s a gag

it’s a dart

it’s a bat

i who never had a club

i just told thеm they hey to ride

and i nеver took a girl

but i made her f+cking ride

and a smile up

and a smile up

put it on f+cking ride

like it is that touch

and she had her dud

and she had her dud

making that sh+t bounce like a habit

it’s a bad habit

it’s a bad habit

n+ggers can’t . .

hold it down

fifteen

it’s a bad habit

it’s a bad habit

n+ggers can’t . .

hold it down

down, down, down

twenty three

[verse 2]

my cell in a accord

your soul in an undone

i know i’m all yours

but you still hold me down

put it to the . . . left

for sound

i’m not gonna let it go down

this song is from my heart

looking for you

like another touch is all i need

i’m calling on your name

cos i’m an orphan from a bar

my touch is enough

is it enough?

my touch is enough

is it enough?

i’m asking

i’m asking

oh o+o+o
