whoa

yeah!

my mind is here

i don’t know

if it feels right now

i don’t know

if it feels good right now

am going for it

i’ma do it for it

pick my cup

took a sip part of it

putting on some crocs

some socks on

i feel warmer a bit

it is dawn

the sun is coming

the birds are

tweeting

and i put it on your oven

and the mead is fine

another hit

another herе

it is a malady

and she’s asking for it

another hеre

it is toxic

what is in my cup

and i’m still sipping on

i don’t give a f+ck

who’s lurking or

who is talking

like my th+rn

it is no burden

it is sodden

this love on the roll

and you know

this is not my; cap him

talking about the

i took her love

and i put it on a other din

all my clothes on dank in the other bin

oh! oh! oh!
