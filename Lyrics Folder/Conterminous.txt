then i’m about to tear it from the f+cking worth

deporting restriction that i call this due

clock boy

i’m cutting these n+ggers out

cos i never had time to be acting like a f+cking coy

i’m that f+cking cog in the f+cking system

i make things run

so you better stick to the d+mn wheel

or i might pivot your ass

make you f+cking count seconds

like it was that time

deal motherf+cker

strum this colour in the d+mn rainbow

like you tryna gill mothеrf+cker

grill all these n+ggеrs on the f+cking plank

they never had time

all they ever do is f+cking bang, bang

[verse 2]

i heard n+ggers who were out there

doing more trucks than the empire

now i’m counting this money

with the f+cking sp+ce in between

bout to get out of my mind

cos i am out with the wolves

and we don’t take f+cking death knee

no love on this board

when i’m speaking, wist

it is this f+cking, this f+cking speak like

this new form

motherf+cker around me, reborn

i ‘on’t even have time for these new ones

they better get it right

or stick with the reborns

cos i’m still caught up with the

f+cking flexing n+ggers, flexing n+ggers

acting like he’s still flexing those muscles

i’m out here when i’m flexing these d+mn muscles

all the zeros

a+wiz in my f+cking incline

so you better get ready for f+cking my recluse

they might eat you up

before the evil speak

i ‘on’t even have time

for these n+ggers caught up

in the psychological warfare of the millean

i’m not even down

i’m the f+cking new born boy

wake up sh+t

on my f+cking sh+t

like it’s that coffee sh+t

cubes in my brain

like i am from china

i don’t even have time

with this f+cking anthro pod poor boys

i am in the next cut

colourful sync like

i think i’ll just return myself to my lover

(laughter)
