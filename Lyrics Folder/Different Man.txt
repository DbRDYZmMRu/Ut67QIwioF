[intro]

i’m a different man

i’m a different man

how it feels

i’m a different man

i’m a different man

how it feels

when you’re not reaching across the bedside for the pills

now my bedside manner something like a prince

i’m a different man

i’m a different man

how it feels


[verse 1]

down on drugs

i’m lost on my guts

i love myself enough for a better duct

not one wanna evolve with this

taping my luck to the stop


[bridge]

i’m not regressing

mixing my love with some yeast

i’m not detesting

reeking herе, soon it’d be a feast

stay interеsting

tear on every record

do i pale now?

[verse 2]

called this above

higher kifs, abs dubs

quarrelling, didn’t have a say

now we say, you were never sane here

children would never receive you

you will never save

and now we say you are


[chorus]

you’re a different man

you’re a different man

how it feels

(yeah, i’m a different man)

you’re a different man

you’re a different man

how it feels

(i’m a different man)

when you’re not reaching across the bedside for the pills

now your bedside manner something like a prince

(something like a prince)

(i’m a prince, and now new friends)

you’re a different man

you’re a different man

how it feels

[outro]

i’m not regressing

mixing my love with some yeast

i’m not detesting

reeking here, soon it’d be a feast

stay interesting

tear on every record

do i pale now?
