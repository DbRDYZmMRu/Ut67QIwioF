[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

life is swift past us

and we try to catch up

with what we caught

for fuss

lost sauce

i think i’m better with my jeans on

looking like i gotta floss

every time i say i love her

a pause

i think i might be out if it

am i really unto it

(am i dancing with my heart)

with my heart


[chorus]

k!lling time

all we do is try to k!ll time

but oh we gotta do it this way

you not alone

this way

you never alone

[verse 2]

i got two tall tops

too tall for my mind to topple now

are you asking is my cup filled

or do i need more

all you’ve ever been is good

i just think i’m outta my

out of my fount of love

a fondness of what i caught


[chorus]

k!lling time

all we do is try to k!ll time

but oh we gotta do it this way

this way
