[intro]

sauce it up a bit

turn the volume up


[verse 1]

ever pondered

how he wonders

does he ever come down

take a bite off my funding

her, female, i’ll take a late

it is coming up a burden

yes another gun

i just took her phone

and i dialled her number raw

she sold me she’ll be with me

father told her that i’ll be with her

make my heart flutter like i’ve won

fly opеn

that song, were you evеr done

the chinny yet on her

for something like her pulley won

for her a poem

that’s the only thing i dreamed of

though you came

and you shined in me the light

i feel woozy, is it right?
