[intro]

i know it hurt sometimes

i’m all right i’ll be fine


[verse 1]

hope on the knotted noose stern of a lasso

strewth!

down from eerie eaves to the patio

rush of blood

rush of blood

heart stops

mine bumps

void of name

still i eat you alive

carry on

carry on

though benighted

i’ma still lay you beside me

heart pieces my kintsugi

[bridge]

i don’t see you in a better light

parts receptacle in, make it feel right

together this heart wreck could be pithy

you’d rather have it last the night

but i’m

still stuck on you

demise of my reason

cos this heart construed

pillow talk till our stalk the talk of the heavens

smiles of ivory (smiles of ivory)

our own penitentiary


[chorus]

i know it hurt sometimes

i’m all right i’ll be fine

i know it hurt at times

i’m all right i’ll be fine


[verse 2]

quaggy heart takes no slithery

staying still streaks of misery

pretty girl with silly dreams

bad wheat makes no dizzy gleams

this hurts like picking bins

me minus i results in why

still i’ll give self for a better shelf

would you be my belt

when sheaths don’t hold

and oars ply burrows

would you play till tomorrow

sake a pale and wake the tale

crane for the page

a lengthy all we did

retorting

depressing

the common pipette in

till we thought we had a thing

top lid

we all did

eyes shut to the already drained

a breaking admit

[bridge]

pillow talk till our stalk the talk of the heavens

smiles of ivory

our own penitentiary


[chorus]

i know it hurt sometimes

i’m all right i’ll be fine

i know it hurt at times

i’m all right i’ll be fine


i know it hurt sometimes

i’m all right i’ll be fine

i know it hurt at times

i’m all right i’ll be fine


[outro]

i know

i know

it hurt at times

hurt at times

i know

i know

it hurt at times

hurts
