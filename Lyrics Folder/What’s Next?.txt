[intro]

yeah

hmm, whoa

sometimes it feels so sad

i ‘on’t know how i am feeling

i’m feeling the higher no healing

i ‘on’t know how i am feeling

it feels lion lying on the ceiling


[verse 1]

prattle pearls

i thought i’d be used to this now

i thought i . . .

hmm

my mind is not right

my mind’s not right

i thought i had it all

now it feels like i can’t get it all like

back to the past

thought that i had a girl

she spoke to me now and it feels like am

going round and picking crumbs

and lighting drums

trying to sing her: they will all lie

that’s her f+cking tick

put my self in a f+cking kite

now it feels that i’ma burn it all wired

n+ggers never had it all

so i’m on fire

i never put it down

so i go higher

higher, in my own f+cking mind

now i’m putting this sh+t

lasso sort the bout

had a f+cking girl she was so d+mn rogue

had to put her back where i f+cking took my clothes

in the f+cking closet

better get used to it

i ‘on’t give a f+ck about n0body

it is you in

i’m now f+ck . . . n+gga you’re scr+w+ng

meh . . . sh+t!

all right

yeah, i am back

and this n+ggers better get it right

i won’t ever f+ck with the f+cking wise

i’m on that f+cking

you are a lie

n+gga had to put that sh+t in my own

my own, my omen

meds

bro! my own f+cking meds

now i’m doing all right

that’s the f+cking best vibe

i’ll ever get

that’s what they said

now i’m better with this sh+t

that’s what is next

i am

i should go on this sh+t one more time

how do you feel about that?

let’s go
