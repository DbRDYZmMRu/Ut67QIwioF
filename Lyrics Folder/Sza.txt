[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

telling lies i’m on my knee baby

is this how it’s gonna be my love

you know i treat you right

i’ll take a bullet for you

would you do the same for me

or am i

caught up in your lie

too caught up in your lies


[verse 1]

can’t blame where we got off

where we are now

i ever fear the distorted

my face doesn’t care

though if i did

not from you

and i call it the base of something new

do i lose my thoughts

do i lose my head

i say for lies on me

heavy on me when i say that

love i got it

well, do i say

do i say

you’re real nighing

[chorus]

telling lies i’m on my knee baby

is this how it’s gonna be my love

you know i treat you right

i’ll take a bullet for you

would you do the same for me

or am i

caught up in your lie

too caught up in your lies


[verse 2]

no lies

no replies

it’s how you are already there fighting

at the cost, it might be the deal

call the world frith

a mile you’re calling

saving my time when you go around

because i thought, i know you got me


[chorus]

telling lies i’m on my knee baby

is this how it’s gonna be my love

you know i treat you right

i’ll take a bullet for you

would you do the same for me

or am i

caught up in your lie

too caught up in your lies
