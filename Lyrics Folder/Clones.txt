[intro]

what is it gonna be the drugs or jess eh?


[bridge]

she ain’t into clones

i’m a godd+mn dope fiend

tap the d+mn b+tton

and she edging through the lines

she ain’t into clones

i’m a godd+mn dope fiend

tap the d+mn b+tton

and she edging through the lines

[chorus]

i can’t get it right when i’m with you

had me feeling like this

ain’t nothing but you

i’m cooling on my cellular phone

thoughts of the one

scheming, smoke

and that’s all on my head

and the voices through my head

they ain’t never; can let go

so i put the f+cking sh+t on a f+cking go

driving through the city i’ma f+cking let it go

go, go


[verse 1]

she had me cloistered; the wall in

ah!

had me loose on the ropes

for her i was slacklining

had it with the role

poem with the rum

snagging stitches on the rove
