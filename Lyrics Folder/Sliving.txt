[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

heavy as my heart

heaviest sole

athletical

a better stare

ferrier, i should set for fear

you can nav it

thus to see the fear

i get it out

mind in awe

i get it alpha in the roam

at the avenue weighing my hurt

i thought i’d beat something better


[verse 2]

never been the type to say

hold up, i’m not ready for this ride

i’m not ready for this, word!

i just wanna hold in

i’ve been down this road too many times

back it up boo

then i put another switch here

light it up smoke it up

it’s how i’m juggling this scroll

arm on dark here

is he never getting home

trying to ask my mama what changed

when i took, then i hit the l!ck

papa told me that s+++ is not on the entropy

[verse 3]

so i’m not ending this trope

walking this stroll

yeah, we sliving, lanyard boy

hey, and you know me

yeah, we know who is kinda

lana new hay

how to love a kid?

i just shot her the car, i paid again

over her, no

how you get her saying

my glade a goal

i just served her, her din

all my vows, i just saved in patent

i just saved it in a link

you’ll get it


[outro]

how they ever wanna feel

her feeling? no!

how they ever wanna see

i never go

i just served her in a beaker

link it now, saving up
