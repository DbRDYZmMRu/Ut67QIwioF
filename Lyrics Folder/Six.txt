[verse 1]

hey!

and she noses

i’m a party young mule

i put her where she never gonzo

yeah

and she knows i’m a party young mule

and i do it for square

and i do it for her

on my miles and goal

and i’m . . .

i’m tryna find a goal then serve her now

and i’m not even looking for no one now

and she knows that’s her

the side for sure

eh!

i need it to take it back

back to the time, and i had a pen, and a note

and i put this jot down

and i had to put my words for data

make a li’l sales

and i’m out in the streets

hiding the streets

out with the game

out with the dream

out with the team

and i’m feeling like nothing can stop me now

so you better get ready for my halogen

me on eulogy

[?]

that explains all my good deeds

and everybody knows how i did

and i have the d+mn go well

[?]

send me your love

bring your love

let the tongue get the bed loud

bring your love

bring the love

let the tongue make the bell, let it ring loud

cos i’m not here to loaf

just here for the loaf

got my girl with me . . .

gold

and she knows that i’m coming for her heart

love’s not a thing when you live this way

love’s not a thing when you love this way

not no deed

i’m coming for this sh+t

all my homers rollers

and we down for the sh+t

down for the shade

down with a brick

and i’m down with the will

and i’m down with a lot of stitch

and i know that i’m down with the bill

and i’m out here to leak

if i down with the ditch

like oh oh

i’m down when the telling is with you

i plummeted and i went for you

you’re never going hit the ground

cos i’m out here with the s on my chest

like them other haters

them other fakers

they can hit the lakers

if they ever had a reason

just to be a baker

i’m still acting like i got no wake up

but i hit the alarm

and that means that i’m ready for the day

i ain’t here for the loafing

just here for the loaf

said it twice

just to feel like i’m down for a dove

eh!

no time for playing

i’m just here

put my legs on the pouffe

and i’m out

puff!

well f+ck!

(hisses)

ah!
