[intro]

i can’t deny a chance to roll it on

i can’t find my wrongs, not right

oh bed!

i get it the hurting


[verse 1]

i can afford shears to right my wrongs

love on your toe

give me a reason, none

more pain

mine is for nothing

you’re up in there

a butcher to everything

i can’t get in that for anything

and i’m stuck in your herb

when i’m stuck on the song

it is the sum that is shooting me down

eye on air

i can get away now

oh i need that air

i need that air

in your clothes were you down

it never change, not this time around

stay here for a change

oh! does he have her changed

no, he doesn’t own this ham

no, he doesn’t screw her

this town i’m bound

hide his music

it will have a change

creole, did it ever change
