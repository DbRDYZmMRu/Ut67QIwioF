[intro]

pooh, you’re on your own

how it goes, how it switches

(your home is in europe.)

my heart feels different

i’m growing

oh well, one day i’ll be what i wanna be

right next to you is where i wanna be


[verse 1]

i’on’t really know

would it ever go wrong

maybe i feel that i’m your lil born

a lie, our real bond, our real bond

i’m born again

h+ll, but in my head, i don’t feel the same

when you’re next to me, i don’t feel the same

as the words don’t ever feel the same

feel the same, i’m in my brain and i feel sane

i’m right herе, what you wanna do

we can stay here, what you wanna say

wе could say yeah

so we are happy, you happy fool

i ‘on’t really give a f+ck though

i’m feeling like it’s enough though

what they say, i ‘on’t really get it though

like oh+oh

it feels really quiet

and my heart’s not, and my thoughts

so over the place

make the ville so loud

would you get me out

talk to me

i ‘on’t really know

i don’t know the difference

would you get me out

talk to me

i ‘on’t really know

the godd+mn difference

mine, i feel it’s mine

why they take it all the time

[verse 2]

i ‘on’t wanna feel like i’m out here whining

i just feel i should be out there grinding

something like sipping my fair drink of trying

to keep my cool when i’m smiling

yes she knows that i’m fine

i’m one to bite in

on that thing that she knows is really crying loud

what you did to me

you received the d+mn pin

i ‘on’t really know

i just feel like i’m in a d+mn pit

there is no devil in here

just me, just me

and i feel like i’m half evil

and it is no light on

and the dark is coming

i just know that you will be coming

and it makes me feel so good

lucky, i feel so good

even when i’m down

i feel good

i just gotta take my mind off and think of you

was it hard? hard, making songs for you

i ‘on’t really know, maybe when i feel it is good

half done, in my head like i’m tryna work her legal

it is the chock , oh it’s chock, d+mn obstructing every time

trust issues, ah

made the jump, make you feel like you’ve got pictures

of being my better self, being my better self, yeah

i’ma be my better self

headed to take a jump, so what i won

yeah, i’ma be my better self

sober for years, like he’s that god of clean

yeah, i think so

it should be
