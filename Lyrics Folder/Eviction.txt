[chorus]

having enough of dosh

i’m hanging up

the sink is done

in the surf, wouldn’t bob

ain’t no twelfth bop

down no another overture

helping often with chores

her parol is i’m up for eviction

devil will never have enough

i’m blaring my siren all the way

call me up

you corral me y’all

cold we are out here

girl we’re off

girl we’re up

cruel we are out here


[verse 1]

meshed in all, a gold, a diva

i’m having all these defers

having all these shivers

no, i’ll never keep her

till i found one

how i know her rows

i know her name

her name, her name, her name

pain

until my line free of your error

i don’t know what is fear

i love how i pair

rear near in the air

[chorus]

having enough of dosh

i’m hanging up

the sink is done

in the surf, wouldn’t bob

ain’t no twelfth bop

down no another overture

helping often with chores

her parol is i’m up for eviction

devil will never have enough

i’m blaring my siren all the way

call me up

you corral me y’all

cold we are out here

girl we’re off

girl we’re up

cruel we are out here
