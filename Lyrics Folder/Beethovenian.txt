[intro]

don’t be mad

this is beethovenian

minding my lips like a. william


[verse 1]

tipping on my level

past time

lurking on a riddle

boxing all my waste sole

yeah, i’m buckling up my waist oh

parasol, and head on

we on

we on

partying up

midi sad hit

long at it

[bridge]

my habit . .

includes looking at you where it is certain

there where it is certain

is right on your lips

girl it’s an habit

partying

party hours in the hurting

i’m partying (hurting)


[chorus]

uh duh

don’t be mad

this is beethovenian

minding my lips like a. william

uh

its enough fiddle fiddling

that’s beat beat beat beating

it isn’t enough until you’re winning

[bridge]
