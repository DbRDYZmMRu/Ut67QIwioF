[intro]

my mood gets through the lam

i’m going through a needle

ah, i got it, put in my heart

this is surreal lam


[verse 1]

my mood jet going through

a d+mn rile needle

my feelings so prurient

d+mn i’ll serve in your tavern

had to swing, swing

she’s giving me the simmer

i’m down, the more i pour that sh+t

loneliness, had the feeling

how the feeling so real

that they want your name

that boast for the nipple

that warm oneness

to you, a warning on this

got me feeling like it’s all inez

the bran on this

the mane so thick like

feeling like a sunniness

[chorus]

my mood is so worse

it’s going through a d+mn needle

my feeling is so poodle

this song is so tired

(guy, you’rе on aim)

my feeling is so bad

it is going through a d+mn needle

my feelings so poignant

godd+mn, i miss you taylor


[verse 2]

keep saying that sh+t

she tied to mе earlier

she’s a godd+mn b+tch

she got a sane b+tch

well, i rode to you

she saw her leash

lied to millions

she’s a godd+mn b+tch

she’ll never leave me

that’s on my ship

that’s on my whip

that’s on my name


[chorus 2]

my mood groove going through

going through a d+mn needle

my feelings so poignant

this song is for your tavern

my mood is so poignant

it is going through a d+mn needle

my feeling so poignant

this song is for your tavern

[verse 3]

yeah!

i like that

i like that

i’ma, i’ma, i’ma let it keep flowing

like yeah

tell me some sh+t

tell me some sh+t

you by my sperm a boy

tell me some sh+t

how you had it f+cked up

and it was on you

ah!

i stole the f+cking court away

i still cry for you all the way

i crush

i still wanna honour you

loving you is so onerous

got me feeling like this ain’t unto us

we got that sh+t

you’re my godd+mn shear

you’re not putting in

no deck, cast my love

so emote, so fast

going through her

[chorus 3]

my mood is so farce

going through a d+mn needle

motherf+cker it is so poignant

this song is for your tavern

my mood is so bad

it is going through a d+mn needle
