[verse 1]

tell me how i can

move myself

i will try

get this out to my consciousness

say it out to the beating what i feel

tell some more words

words pour their rays on


[chorus]

i think i know what pain is

i think i know what it is

i think i know what joy is

i think i know what it is


[verse 2]

holy f+ck

(laughter)

okay, yeah

hmm

not much to say

but i will say this though

i have been in a place

where i’ve been down

and i thought

i’d never find a way out

yeah, i’ve been quite so sad oh

not for too long

but i had to pull the jack fast

had to put the cut+out fast

like, no light attaches

need to be out

so i know what pain is

and i know what it is

when your thoughts keep going

and they want also to be ended

and i know when every reflex

and every sign just says

it has come to an еnd

yeah

and you seek the end

and you gеt to the end

and you wake up

and you’re still alive

and you’re just mad

mad at the crazy substance you’ve got in your body

just, just wanted better

and now you have to deal with it

you’re back in life

it’s the air out there

still electricity; it is still up

it’s dark, the sun is out

and, it just all sucks

’cause now

death is more expensive

than you thought it was before

and it isn’t much of pain

you’re just stuck, stuck in life

just stuck, stuck

f+cking stuck
