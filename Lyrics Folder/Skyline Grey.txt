[verse 1]

can’t get over you

can’t get over you

out of my head is where i need you

feel through

so see through

f+ck sh+t up

sombre flush

she k!lling my vibe

some sh+t’s off

fuss shrieks surf

why you k!lling my vibe

cos you’re my lover

put you afloat every other

push come to shove

remote carry orders

skyline feels so grey

dissipate what a waste

buds don’t taste

f+ck it

i’ma let it go all to waste

[chorus]

can we do it all again

i can’t just weep through this pain

can we do it all again

i can’t just weep through all these pain


[verse 2]

sometimes i just want you outta my mind

how you got me hanging all the time

maze of feels

teasing k!lls

sleeping pills so undulated

hallucinations sеrrated

i just want you outta my godd+mn head

bleeding through thesе fears

don’t tell me i need a pacer

i just wanna erase ya

right here got me feeling i can’t replace ya

sum it up for a taste of your love


[chorus]

can we do it all again

i can’t just weep through this pain

can we do it all again

i can’t just weep through all these pain
