[verse 1]

tryna take myself seriously

put the right ribbon in on the outfit

how well am i doing with the elite?

i yap a lot on the ascend

oh!

and my fist still fits right

in the wall

even though it’s framed

doesn’t blink at my alarming

she .

she’s always working

cos she’s up truffleupagus

i plain

too long

longing still

i can’t . . . wobbling


[chorus]

abba or dada

hack hard

abba or dada

hack hard

abba or dada

hack hard

i’ll be there

abba or dada

hack hard

i’ll be there
