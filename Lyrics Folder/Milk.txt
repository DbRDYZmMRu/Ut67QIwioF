[intro]

oh oh

hey

ho!


[bridge]

i’ll never reek of dishonesty

i’ma keep a seat

even though it hurts

had my soul wound up

bales and bales of chemistry

banter off fanta

now i can’t get enough

[verse 1]

sashay my way

cl!ck the b+tt

how you felt

cos i never had it that way

never the type to push b+ttons

made the memory stick

moonbeam in a jar

voyeurs on esoteric talk

parallel universe

ashtray mâché

smouldering thoughts

crush off his shrooms

hit my phone

make it feel the same way

cliché even though it means

we won’t fix this

someday

all day it’ll be okay


[chorus]

milk milk milk milk

i’ll be milking on her love

milk milk milk milk

such an allure

it’s such a lure

milk milk milk milk

i’ll be milking on her love

milk milk milk milk

such an allure

it’s such a lure

[bridge]

i’ll never reek of dishonesty

i’ma keep a seat

even though it hurts

had my soul wound up

bales and bales of chemistry

banter off fanta

now i can’t get enough


[verse 2]

took too much

spilling

now am feeling like

i can’t get above this

no

whoa

attitude with this sh+t

i feel like i’ma get an orbit

rooms dim lit

hiccups i sipped all my horl!cks

battlefield am on your tail

what’s your hobby?

zip+line to your room

are you pouty girl?

i ‘on’t miss my head

it’s already head

[bridge]

i’ll never reek of dishonesty

i’ma keep a seat

even though it hurts

had my soul wound up

bales and bales of chemistry

banter off fanta

now i can’t get enough


[chorus]

milk milk milk milk

i’ll be milking on her love

milk milk milk milk

such an allure

it’s such a lure

milk milk milk milk

i’ll be milking on her love

milk milk milk milk

such an allure

it’s such a lure


[outro]

i’ll be milking

i’ll be milking on her love

i’ll be milking

how milking on the love?

it is forever that blunt

milk! milk! milk!

it is forever that blunt

milk!
