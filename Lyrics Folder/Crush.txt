[intro]

Fresh boy chilling

[verse 1]

Falling before we spiral

Fettered in banter

Hot in winter

Stuck in the center

[chorus]

Feelings of i lost her, you’re no longer in

Feelings of her l ster lingering

Feelings of i lost her in lane, ringing her rein

Feelings of i lost her lingering

[verse 2]

Faded memories

Switching fantasies

Growing habits and dead ties

[chorus]

Feelings of i lost her, you’re no longer in

Feelings of her l ster lingering

Feelings of i lost her in lane, ringing her rein

Feelings of i lost her lingering
