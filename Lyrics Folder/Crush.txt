[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

falling before we spiral

fettered in banter

hot in winter

stuck in the center


[chorus]

feelings of i lost her, you’re no longer in

feelings of her l+ster lingering

feelings of i lost her in lane, ringing her rein

feelings of i lost her lingering


[verse 2]

faded memories

switching fantasies

growing habits and dead ties


[chorus]

feelings of i lost her, you’re no longer in

feelings of her l+ster lingering

feelings of i lost her in lane, ringing her rein

feelings of i lost her lingering
