[intro]

whoa oh

hey

and you know we do it

i’m not over addison

i just had to say it roam


[verse 1]

it’s the logophile with another amnion

whoa oh

chary with my words

i don’t ever carry

load of patootie

she’s got me on a ladle

cordon round my shen

how you bound me with a sn+tch

cortège in the pool

i’m unto her coiffure

like a winning door

katharevousa

come and christian me dior

i quill a poem, if she’ll let me have it

potpourri her winning answer

addison ejecting hanker

bye to the loo

former thoughts on how i am having you

doggerel on the shoo

your bum poky salacious

attuned to my nature

acclaiming, you’re voluptuous

tongue in hеre like i’m newton

banging likе a new sheen

d+mning that’s a new . . . that’s off the grill

[verse 2]

addison, you’ve got me vociferous

penning so impetuous

impassioned to a fizzy sprawl

shrieking off a raki l+st

dreaming this in nature’s chores

togs off bathing in deliquesce

pr+cking off a page so just

love you like a granny’s dutch

here is mummy’s hutch

be mine, a grokking much

lunching off your bum hump pad

beauty like an akimbo stand

voice, dulcet rose+gold

face stormy petrel dish

i think i hear baby cries
