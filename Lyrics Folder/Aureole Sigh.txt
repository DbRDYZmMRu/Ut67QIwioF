[intro]

hey yo

come around and see

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

many minks on me

many eyes on my girl

fly away with me

we could go aureole sigh

fly away with me

we could go running town

coot in now

could now

pin down, pen down

everything i feel about

i’m good now

i’m coot now

penning down

on everything i feel about you


[verse 2]

and i know what stops me

when i get to it

to where you at

i love how you bring your phone

and get to wave

here to wet

when you put your thoughts and fade

i say to it

i’m not letting go

not letting go

with you by side

[chorus]

up in the air is where i’m living it up

not down here

old sins my down on the horde

i say, never been on earth

up in the air is where i’m living it up

the soap don’t harm my soul

never been on earth

up in the air

up in you

just living it up


[verse 3]

shy, trivial sh+t

blabber sh+t

i get off fun linking all your hull

i get my foot in there

i’m meaning to say

i love you worst than i could say

i cry to find a power way

to let my seep carry it in


[chorus]

up in the air is where i’m living it up

not down here

old sins my down on the horde

i say, never been on earth

up in the air is where i’m living it up

the soap don’t harm my soul

never been on earth

up in the air

up in you

just living it up

[outro]

oh oh

i can ride for certain

my foot
