[chorus]

I won’t say

I won’t say it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

You don’t feel it

Where is my position

Oh, where is my competition

Mace is my vision

Oh, where is my competition

[chorus]

I won’t say

I won’t say it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

You don’t feel it

Where is my position

Oh, where is my competition

Mace is my vision

Oh, where is my competition

[verse 1]

Dross on me

Flunking that crunching crumb

I ponder my name on some

Forget the round

Does it, ever held like a mad chomp

Forfeit the round

[chorus]

I won’t say

I won’t say it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

You don’t feel it

Where is my position

Oh, where is my competition

Macе is my vision

Oh, where is my competition

[chorus]

I won’t say

I won’t say it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

Whеn you say you don’t feel it

I won’t say

I won’t say it

When you say you don’t feel it

You don’t feel it

Where is my position

Oh, where is my competition

Mace is my vision

Oh, where is my competition

[verse 2]

Dross on me

Flunking that crunching crumb

I ponder my name on some

Forget the round

Does it, ever held like a mad chomp

Forfeit the round
