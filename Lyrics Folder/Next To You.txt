[ chorus ]

my thought

i can’t get it right

when i’m next to you

can’t utter it right

my view on the best of you

got me stringing these words like am next to you

got me feeling like this ain’t next to you

my thought

i can’t get it right

when i’m next to you

can’t utter it right

my view on the best of you

got me stringing these words like am next to you

[ verse 1 ]

got me swinging this whole

like i’m on my imp

you’re the demon

that’s trailing all these brain rut

h+llo pane and what you say is not

hump in this hole and i’m buzzing your stale

can’t no snarl

snag at my soul

h+llo

bane heart

maudlin

sputtering waned out

demons on me

they out

they weighing+ing out


[ bridge ]


i can’t get it right

i keep sealing all these willing

i can’t get it right


glib glib glib

it’s a part i’m not playing

glib glib glib

it’s a part i’m not playing

woooo oooo


[ chorus ]

my thought

i can’t get it right

when i’m next to you

can’t utter it right

my view on the best of you

got me stringing these words like am next to you

got me feeling like this ain’t next to you

my thought

i can’t get it right

when i’m next to you

can’t utter it right

my view on the best of you

got me stringing these words like am next to you
