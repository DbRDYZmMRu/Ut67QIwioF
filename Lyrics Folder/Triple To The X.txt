i never wanna tell you how it goes

never waiting on the walls

resting

i’m right for it

i already know

f+cked up?

i’m ready

i don’t want this success on my f+cking pain

i just want the love filling me up

and i’m going away

when i am going away

trying to reach you

when you mind the closer

i can’t get you

you’re the spark

whizz

this time mind’s appalled the asunder

how it feels

how it feels

when you work the self

how it feels

how it feels

when i feel

i’m searching for your heart

i don’t wanna be devastated in my head

you should me fill up

i don’t want her a lone one

i don’t want this sauce in my cuff

i’m acting cordial to you in a while

whoa

i’m reaching

a valve

i’m with your house

through it all

she had me y’all

she got me down

when i was laid there

she’d lie there by my side

triple to the x

triple to the plex (solar plexus)

triple to the:

now i’m feeling like

i can’t get my self without it all

looking at the star

looking at tomorrow

looking out for north
