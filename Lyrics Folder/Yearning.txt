[intro]

hmm, i’m proceeding

i get really pensive with my thoughts

when i want to talk to you

but it’s fine

this is a birthday take

it is to . . . just ah

warm you to the new beginning


[bridge]

angler without a buck

that’s me on hanging on to luck

pulling on a lead

that’s it, enough with the risk

lame to the bee

can i have you no passing to him

a nose cheetah

whose cheating

it’s no sh+tting

i’m on it

her mileage on

bet i have her for the bonk

when she has a writ

tell her it’s about marking off the beat

my hearts on gild

making it quick to a page of poses

off with my moaning

i’m closing in

it’s hawking

[chorus]

tell this off then

to tell this often

can you tell this off thеn

my love i’m yearning

will you tell this off thеn

when you tell this often

can you tell this off then

my love in a moment in the vain


[verse 1]

then they tape it off

we mark it up with our wins

a crime scene

he ascended to an early boggle win

in her shoes

he f+cked her

and they never had a cause to wrestle

they had it

the tattoos, the cars too

made an early brag too

my d stroking

if you were here

it’d be re+plugging

it’s my mind talking

if you were here

that’d be your lips talking
