[verse 1]

forever

i’m feeling like it is forever

when i take my drivers

put them in the arrivals

i’m feeling like it’s forever

when i take my time

and i put these words

on the d+mn bic

girl, i’m feeling like it is forever

your light shinning not a gleam

aim, you know that this is not the scene

in the bed girl, i’m not making you scream

just making you find out

what is about to be in the dream

that is not 808

that is me on the severe

you’re the lane


[verse 2]

silver lean, baby lean

i’m tryna get my mind off

these other lean, ease us

dreamings of all the planets

i ‘on’t even know why i even got the habit

but it’s me shining

you make me shine girl

even though when it’s just a feeling

that i am trying to hold on to this . . .

[verse 3]

okay

going on this with my eyes closed

mind open like it’s our toast

and i am feeling i don’t get those

no more baby come on me

i just want to get to this

i am not trying to pour

no, it’s not a rainfall

it’s not a windfall

it’s just me, and i am acting poor

with your emotions

yeah, it is the abortions

i don’t get it off

it is the versions

i’m lost in my conscience

and that’s makes me feel like

i could be something like a vulture

tell me what it feels like

i like it when you’re not around

and tell me what it feels like

when i bother about

the things that i haven’t said

things that i might just get around

and get over my heart or its census

of how i am feeling for another

cut it out like i was not for the bags, i guts

of my living in the scene

barking like talking, big in on this vein

[outro]

yeah

it’s no time to do it again

it’s one take and i have this in the lake

i have been pondering my convictions

and things that i say

if they’re true with the diction

’cause i won’t say them twice

and i wonder if everyone here was the price

i’m still working with this

it is my dynamo, let’s do it again
