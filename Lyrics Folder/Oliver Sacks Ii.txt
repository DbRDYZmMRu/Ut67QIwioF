[intro]

it’s a bang

and no one is

no one is in here

i’ve been a bad story teller

fresh boy chilling

time to get it back


[verse 1]

looking at it from the right side

i had to tell him boy this is not a pile

i had to tell him look again

this is not a pie

i had to tell him again

this is not the right side

so i told him

you can go out there

you can be whatever you wanna be

but just don’t leak it out

that it’s from me

cos i’ve been in this place

and my roof has been leaking

that means i have not got everything figured out

like alibi, you can tell me

i’m still older

i can do whatever i want

a dime meet somе caller

not with the fries

i’m in with thе pious

stick to the same script

we’re still talking about that

[verse 2]

if you’re convinced that is the left

then that could mean

that we’ve got nothing left

cos this bar is not enough above us

so you can go out and go find your

flax time, i mean the facts machine

trying to get it out like

i never got the ashes

out of the f+cking place

of their working her knees

dude you never told me

you didn’t evolve in the world war

so waltz, get it out

tell them you got her back

tell them you chew it with her fat ass

and you can do it

like it’s nothing with the facts asked

but never let them know

you ain’t got no heart hacks

so let me, i can give you free keys

hike in lekki

know that it’s not about the lead keys

you know we had that for over a century

and you were still born

so what’s with the f+cking internet

i’m still with the f+cking baton

not over love, while you’re stuck with your card in

no, he never told me i could even do it

in front and out of the booth

so you know you got take it to the vision

legal, it’s not me

i’m just seeking with the he shuns

[verse 3]

yeah, if he ever has eyes on your ancient

then you couldn’t take it out

tell him all of the tees, it’s yours i paid

dial on me there

you can go f+ck yourself off in the

(laughter)

penetrate, sure yeah

all you ever think is daddy i average in numb

i’m locking it out

i’m locking it back

tryna get my soulmate

this is not a rehearsal

this is my piece

this is my peace

come back here

i told you

this is my piece

i lost one time

but not this time

weekend out

feeling like it’s my whine

my wine cos it’s mine
