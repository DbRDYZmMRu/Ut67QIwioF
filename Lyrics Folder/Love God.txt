[intro]

everything comes to a stop

you hear a bop

and you feel like you’ve got a nod

but it’s all just warp


[verse 1]

would you take me back

i need the rap

i gotta know

would you take me back

i need a rap

would you tell me that it’s not been elapsed


[chorus]

would you take me back

i gotta know

i gotta know

i’ve been a perv for earning

have it amassed it

having a missed diary

i’ve been in love with all that

have been absorbed with all that

having the one’s that

stay in heaven with the love god

[verse 2]

to tell you

girl i don’t know

i’m not the one who is stirred in

dead on the ratio

we should just be friends

something about this notion

of mе always being me instead

you should tеll on that weekend

i’ll hide and fool you

you’re in his stead

and i will say, you are a deputy in

it’s not over in his end


[verse 3]

i don’t know what you hear

don’t know what you see in my heart

flame on, know you are risking the lily

it is just no pretence

she ever know

it’s your yabber you know

once it is word, i’m here

i’m your lover again

she say that she cares

his word i touch

on my soap you’re back

it’s still the faith in him

missing him in i like your name

a no on stuck

caved in

could be you’re in your habit

of this say you are reeling now

my self on this

[verse 4]

dates, weeks, days

sound, never say no

would you let me down when it’s just business

if she’s the hour now

cushion on my mind

what’s the time

if she had time

cheesy the only tee is sounds

just mention, buzz me when it’s you

i on’t really know if it’s true

that this man is about this mood

or i should touch myself

it’s time i prove it

damming i ain’t your ex like

i don’t really know

but days to weekend

not my descends


[chorus]

would you take me back

i gotta know

i gotta know

i’ve been a perv for earning

have it amassed at

having a missed diary

i’ve been in love with all that

have been absorbed with all that

having the one’s that

stay in heaven with the love god

[chorus]

would you take me back

i gotta know

i gotta know

i’ve been a perv for earning

have it amassed at

having a missed diary

i’ve been in love with all that

have been absorbed with all that

having the one’s that

stay in heaven with the love god
