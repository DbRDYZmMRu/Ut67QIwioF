[intro]

fresh boy chilling

how do you be?


[verse 1]

this picture has got me feeling so uneasy

nothing beats it

when i’m so busy here

she’s lurking, she’s looking at me

like a monalisa

i think i see a face of putin

acting like i don’t see enough

am i her biden?

buy her sting or leave


[chorus]

nothing makes me feel so alive

when you come around

and put a smile on me

haven’t had enough

i need you back on me

back on me oh oh

nothing makes me feel so alive

when will you come around

and put a smile on me girl

haven’t felt alive

havеn’t had enough

haven’t had enough

i need you back on mе

[verse 2]

i miss you

i wanna be with you

i don’t get my life right now

when i’m half with you

out for you

i feel this way

i don’t get it how i feel

feeling like the seas are calling

i’m really feeling sick girl

feel my temperature

something like stunned


[chorus]

nothing makes me feel so alive

when you come around

and put a smile on me

haven’t had enough

i need you back on me

back on me oh oh

nothing makes me feel so alive

when will you come around

and put a smile on me girl

haven’t felt alive

haven’t had enough

haven’t had enough

i need you back on me
