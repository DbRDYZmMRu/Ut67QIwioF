[chorus]

there is no scene in the reel

that ass don’t end with me tonight

chiefly cos i don’t see a way to end me here

there is no pretty face that’s still evincing me tonight

that ass got me

i’m winning her ground, i’m fisting

and i’m tickled before i kiss it

i don’t leg it, i’m with a cleat with it

i’m seating harm
