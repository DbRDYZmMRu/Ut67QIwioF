[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

too caught up to say

what i truly feel

nothing in my heart

that will probably k!ll me

i’m on this

too high tent

on your ebullitions i rely

when i see you here

i mean it too much

feeling too lauded for this

and right now i get it off

wherever i’m seeing your face

who isn’t in my head


[verse 2]

telling how with this over again

i stall you a mile away

instead you need a field of faeries

and i unct you there

what could be mine

not couldn’t be mine

how i fill the airway

so written in stone

that house i’m forever
