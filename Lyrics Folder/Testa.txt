[chorus]

i found a girl

might say it open

i found a girl

might say it’s the end

but is it the way i will feel

the way i’ll gain

the way i’ll pay

burr day

sail, i did your way

i will say

i came

for testa

oh comments, common best to her

someone better, someone better

someone best to us

my cursive not holding this down


[verse 1]

i’m waning, i’m whining

when i take my ends

and i’m heavy on this

feeling, feeling

i don’t know how to let it go


[verse 2]

maybe this won’t come around again

this pessimistic feeling

maybe baby i’ll save that i can let it go

i’ll say i won’t fight it

but i’m going to honing

and i mean this . . .

to on my ward

i’m going to owning

my mistakes, my phase of poverty in

brother i think i have it

nothing personal just above it

come on, we go check on her

this picture

i’m out this hung

easy here

beating in my heart

photo apart

would i give back

what i’ve never never had

never never will i half

oh oh

still mode, too much effects

that’s how she commands
