[intro]

Fresh boy chilling

The real ramification of things i ponder is

They will end up in some action

So

[verse 1]

How about we go out tonight

Get ourselves stained tonight

[chorus]

I found a place

And famous for being how i

Get through my day

(my day)

Get through my fate

(my fate)

I’ve been d mned to love

(d mned to love)

Love too much

(too much)

I’ve been d mned to love

(d mned to love)

Love too much

(too much)

Love too much

[verse 2]

Come over here

Can take you home

If you don’t like the air

So infamous

For being a bad ass man

With an addict cut in fame
