[intro]

fresh boy chilling

the real ramification of things i ponder is

they will end up in some action

so


[verse 1]

how about we go out tonight

get ourselves stained tonight


[chorus]

i found a place

and famous for being how i

get through my day

(my day)

get through my fate

(my fate)

i’ve been d+mned to love

(d+mned to love)

love too much

(too much)

i’ve been d+mned to love

(d+mned to love)

love too much

(too much)

love too much

[verse 2]

come over here

can take you home

if you don’t like the air

so infamous

for being a bad ass man

with an addict cut in fame
