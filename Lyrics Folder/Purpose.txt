[chorus]

young boy with purpose

your alarm is purpose

purpose

demola it is purpose

purpose

your alarm is purpose

purpose

demola it is


[verse 1]

the time counts

the day grinds

and my love

doesn’t ever expire

my touch is something

like perspiring

i’m not giving up now

know what’s the time

candy now

you need some way

that’s moving now

at home

just gotta have a tape in

my covenant with living

if you’re a sage

capital will save you a run

i’m on

i’m morn

i’m on a hobby

a tale

if i come around

i’ll save you a trail

if i keep my love

cinched to you

[bridge]

i’m not singing for anyone

in particular

it is just like

i never get the anon

so it is .

it is likе ah .

is it a smiling dove

you know

like singing for a dove

(giggling)


[chorus]

young boy it is purposе

purpose

your alarm is purpose

purpose

young boy it is purpose

purpose

your alarm is coming

coming

young boy it is
