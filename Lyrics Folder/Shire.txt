[intro]

say you want it too

i want it too

i’ll buy it too

i want it too

i’ll fight for you


[verse 1]

get it going

off the bench

eyeing that man

counting his cheques

i never had the bands

that’s a fact

when it is d+mn time

meet him outside

and she d+mn know it

she d+mn know it

i never won a mill

i’m always on my prof

yes she know it

you should know it

i’m locked; this profane


[verse 2]

sorry, sorry for our date away

sorry, sorry isn’t my pen away?

thrill, hoot your body

here with me

when i’m feeling i can’t get on your ride

i unnerve myself when i’m not with you

poor paddy

i love it when it is your body

will i ever get it right

it is your body

i’m not myself, well i met the anejo

and i’m not in applausе

tell me it is not certain

i’m not lеtter, a verse

that’s why, yes knock on my shoo

i’m in the party so crack your sh+t up

i ain’t got no time just to be the prey either

hand in my air

like i’m tryna move sh+t

i’m in my movie, it’s not going away

whether she down

am i?

she’s that woman

i’m not fooling around

i’m caught in the rain

i made her mine

i’m surreal living

i’m taking this time to feign your leaving

like i’m for her dain’t in my brailling

moving this other reign

i’m f+cking with my self

does it ever matter

will i ever come back to the surf

oh we are stuck

still out of my earning

silver rain dissolve this pain

ether over my veins

like i’m not going nowhere

if i do not . . . the sum y’all owe

the case in the page is

will she stay?

will i see her?

stay and her see if it is my case

looking like oh you got nothing on

is how i’m gonna be with you

looking like you got something on

is that issue, are you down with me?

ah, even i live and write, down the line

oh fooling around, it is my shire

(laughter)

so will you leave a clue?
