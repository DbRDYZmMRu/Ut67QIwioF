[chorus]

beat me down

isn’t that exactly what you want

beat me down

all the fuss just a floss for your wrongs

beat me down

on a foray clowned up for your trust

beat me down

unhitched stitches

beat me down

isn’t that exactly what you want

beat me down

all the fuss just a floss for your wrongs

beat me down

on this foray clowned up for your trust

beat me down

[verse 1]

i can’t take it

i can’t pretend i’m fine

why you riding us down?

we should be flying altitudes high

carry+on for the pride

sated fine while i cry

party on while i sit forlorn

fast to whisk my claws

you keep me on my toes

writhing on this languid ship

surely for a wish i’d choose to die alone

die alone

die alone

my journal says i don’t fair alone

fair alone

how you’re my only pheromone

so long you’ve been my gleaming hope

seething prose

filled with words

curse this fissure i loathe

how you’re my

only pheromone

so long you’ve been my gleaming hope


[2nd chorus]

beat me down

isn’t that exactly what you want

beat me down

on a foray clowned up for your trust

beat me down

all the fuss just a floss for your wrongs

beat me down

unhitch stitches

beat me down

isn’t that exactly what you want

beat me down

on a foray clowned up for your trust

beat me down

all the fuss just a floss for your wrongs

beat me down

[verse 2]

beat me down

be on your way why you acting; you don’t care

‘fore it sears leave with the tears

here’s a scissor i’ll shear all the reasons

the pictures of leisures

no tissues

you should get your soul attended to

probably don’t know but here is a whole lot to sleep to

are you tuned in?

are you tuned in?

how you ruining

why you call it pruning

months of duds

cared that we pulling

did you care?

did you ever care that we pulling?

morning feigned

heaped the dune in

now am hanging on

what we ruining

and i’m longing on

all the days the nights that we had

pulling all the scenes together

how holding on?
