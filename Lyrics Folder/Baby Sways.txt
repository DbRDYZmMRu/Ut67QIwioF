This song is . .

Like a silly way of saying i am sorry after . .

Being bad

(chortles)

Quite clever

[chorus]

My baby sways

Takes it all home

My baby’s ways

My baby sways

Takes it all home

Always has her taste

[bridge]

How she likes it

She’s ruined my night

Drop a ball

And ruin my dance

Have a fit

And lose at the part

I’m at that part

Where i don’t get the ring back

[chorus]

My baby sways

Takes it all home

My baby’s ways

My baby sways

Takes it all home

Always has her taste

[bridge]

How she likes it

She’s ruined my night

Drop a ball

And ruin my dance

Have a fit

And lose at the part

I’m at that part

Where i don’t get thе ring back

[verse 1]

Time to time

How many times you tеll me

You’ve got me on this dining

D mning

I’m tryna be the damsel in distress

[chorus]

My baby sways

Takes it all home

My baby’s ways

My baby sways

Takes it all home

Always has her taste

Uh!

[chorus]

My baby sways

Takes it all home

My baby’s ways

My baby sways

Takes it all home

Always has her taste

[bridge]

How she likes it

She’s ruined my night

Drop a ball

And ruin my dance

Have a fit

And lose at the part

I’m at that part

Where i don’t get the ring back

[outro]

Yeah
