[into]

this song is . .

like a silly way of saying i am sorry after . .

being bad

(chortles)

quite clever


[chorus]

my baby sways

takes it all home

my baby’s ways

my baby sways

takes it all home

always has her taste

[bridge]

how she likes it

she’s ruined my night

drop a ball

and ruin my dance

have a fit

and lose at the part

i’m at that part

where i don’t get the ring back


[chorus]

my baby sways

takes it all home

my baby’s ways

my baby sways

takes it all home

always has her taste


[bridge]

how she likes it

she’s ruined my night

drop a ball

and ruin my dance

have a fit

and lose at the part

i’m at that part

where i don’t get thе ring back

[verse 1]

time to time

how many times you tеll me

you’ve got me on this dining

d+mning

i’m tryna be the damsel in distress


[chorus]

my baby sways

takes it all home

my baby’s ways

my baby sways

takes it all home

always has her taste

uh!


[chorus]

my baby sways

takes it all home

my baby’s ways

my baby sways

takes it all home

always has her taste


[bridge]

how she likes it

she’s ruined my night

drop a ball

and ruin my dance

have a fit

and lose at the part

i’m at that part

where i don’t get the ring back

[outro]

yeah
