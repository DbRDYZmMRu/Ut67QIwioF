[verse 1]

have you seen a pretty girl walk around here

(walking around)

she could have your heart

have you call out

(she got mine)

help! (help)

i think she just spilled my heart in two

(oh+oh)

help, she just called home alone

(shhh)

ping on my lover

i hope i get your response real fast

talking to you

everyday, don’t bother me no way


[verse 2]

i wish i could stare at her

in a manner and spill her garden

wishing dreams come true

break her out of her author

like bеing in her fate

favourite, pacе it

oh i grieve my time away

when i’m, freaking

i don’t know what to say

oh girl, not today

(not today)

oh lover not today

(not today)

[verse 3]

i fall from high ground

to your warm hands my bride

(my bride)

how i’m feeling now

i couldn’t put down with a thousand words

(way)

i might have to write a whole prayer braille

just to say i crave her visage

(pretty)

feeling like grease to cars

let’s go
