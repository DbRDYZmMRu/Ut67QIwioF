[verse 1]

she’s like no other

that’s why she’s my girl

she blows the covers

that’s why she’s my wifey

my love like no other

come here be my

yup

be my hump


[verse 2]

wimple off that’s her club

pair is on, won’t you what say was wrong

mine’s been on for a thousand years

if we are a soul

i think woah

all i ever do is clean on my phone

tryna know if i ever took a petty role

merry+go, take away the year

she ghosts, i don’t feel my toes

my love’s been hock . . .

till you lie in orient

i need to know

would you let me go

no, another road

for it we go, let’s just go

[verse 3]

mayday, my lady has been calling me

saying baby

i think i want that wedding ring

oh+oh+oh+oh

i think i want that wedding ring

spinning drag

why do we go

i could do the racing in the running and gone

i know, every time i’m on it

like a police

chasing you my pretty fugitive

i’m your police

i’m unto you my wifey

i’m unto you my wifey

i’m unto you my wifey
