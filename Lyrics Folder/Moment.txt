[intro]

i just wanna live in the moment

loving you got me ebbing ma wrong steps

i just wanna live in the moment

loving you got me ebbing ma wrong steps


[chorus]

trapped in the closet for days

i’ve been spooled for days

4+6+8 lines

i can’t get you out my brain

ain’t love a strain?

comatose dreaming

springed up bun

girl you’re my favourite banshee

[ verse 1 ]

caught up in this love

humming all your undertones

feeling like a palm on the beach

have me waving on

catch my hitchhike

sway me like a w+lly whirl

d+mn the drill

you’re the heroine

annal, can i get it right

oh you lovе

d+mn, suasive, swear

can i get it right

oh you’rе the lover with the sway

swell, swell, swell, swell


[chorus]

trapped in the closet for days

i’ve been spooled for days

4+6+8 lines

i can’t get you out my brain

ain’t love a strain?

comatose dreaming

springed up bun

girl you’re my favourite banshee

[verse 2]

yeah!

player board

stop, first time

was big bunny

when do i ever get it right

it’s a privy party

i don’t really know if they say it often

pen on pair


[bridge]

i just wanna live in the moment

loving you got me ebbing ma wrong steps

i just wanna live in the moment

loving you got me ebbing ma wrong steps


[chorus]

trapped in the closet for days

i’ve been spooled for days

4+6+8 lines

i can’t get you out my brain

ain’t love a strain?

comatose dreaming

springed up bun

girl you’re my favourite banshee
