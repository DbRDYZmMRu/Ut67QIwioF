for her, i’ll ride

my bride

how to pick the pieces

at your door i pace dumb

[verse 1]

how are we feeling groom?

pock, pock, too much

made up, we go tall, we are up

does it ever stop

i know overall what it says

peel my flop to say . . .

whittle my actions

never gone


[bridge]

for her, i’ll ride

my bride

feeling numb

[verse 2]

sorry, dad doesn’t make enough

. . . to fickle feather, lifе; a nickel gone

to me, likе we are one

i know, i evolve on

under, you are a fan

so it goes that


[bridge]

for her, i’ll ride

my bride

feeling numb

bail my heart
