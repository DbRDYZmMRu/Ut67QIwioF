[intro]

For her, i’ll ride

My bride

Feeling numb

How to pick the pieces

At your door i pace dumb

[chorus]

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

[verse 1]

How are we feeling groom?

Pock, pock, too much

Made up, we go tall, we are up

Does it ever stop

I know overall what it says

Peel my flop to say . . .

Whittle my actions

Never gone

[bridge]

For her, i’ll ride

My bride

Feeling numb

[chorus]

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

[verse 2]

Sorry, dad doesn’t make enough

. . . to fickle feather, lifе; a nickel gone

To me, likе we are one

I know, i evolve on

Under, you are a fan

So it goes that

[bridge]

For her, i’ll ride

My bride

Feeling numb

[chorus]

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

Oh disclose

This close

This prose

[outro]

Bail my heart

Bail my heart

Impale my horror
