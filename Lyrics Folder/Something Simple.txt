[chorus]

tell me something simple

if this all right

we can get it

just tell me something really simple

it’s a drilly ride we can kick it

cos i don’t wanna be stuck in the motion with you

ah!

i don’t wanna be stuck in the muddle with you

i just wanna get it right

can you tell me something simple?

something simple

eh!

cos it’s something simple

yeah!

[verse 1]

i’ll be stuck on a rev with you

chasing your love down a one+way street

my heart won’t let the fetter escape

i want you gripping me in your love

your spot is wherе i wanna touch

can i can i hold on?

your door is where i wanna stand on in felicity

how you makе me (how you make me)

is all fuzz enough (hey! hey! hey!)

how you hold me is all fuzz enough

hey! hey! hey!
