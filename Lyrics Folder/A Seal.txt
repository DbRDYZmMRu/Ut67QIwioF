[intro]

Is it true

Like you feel

Something i could seal

[chorus]

Is it true

You feel

Something i could seal

[verse 1]

Asking me; hard to say

My emotions are here to stay

Sometimes to love

Sometimes i’m a bore

Sometimes i just want to pour some more

[chorus]

Is it true

You feel

Something i could seal

(i could say i’ll be the deal)

[verse 2]

Wishing for some more

For some more time

Hip and up

Keeping up from

I’m in dental

To dent to her

[verse 3]

Would you love

Love love love

Too too much

(too much)

Dissolving his spur

(too much love)

[chorus]

Is it true

That you feel

Somеthing i could seal

[chorus]

Is it true

You feel

Something i could sеal

[outro]

Emotions, some more

I’m willing to give all i’ve got

Emotions, some more

I’m willing to give all i’ve got
