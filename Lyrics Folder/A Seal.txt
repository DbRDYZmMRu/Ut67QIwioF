like you feel

something i could seal


[chorus]

is it true

you feel

something i could seal


[verse 1]

asking me; hard to say

my emotions are here to stay

sometimes to love

sometimes i’m a bore

sometimes i just want to pour some more


[chorus]

is it true

you feel

something i could seal

(i could say i’ll be the deal)


[verse 2]

wishing for some more

for some more time

hip and up

keeping up from

i’m in dental

to dent to her

[verse 3]

would you love

love love love

too too much

(too much)

dissolving his spur

(too much love)


[chorus]

is it true

that you feel

somеthing i could seal


[chorus]

is it true

you feel

something i could sеal


[outro]

emotions, some more

i’m willing to give all i’ve got

emotions, some more

i’m willing to give all i’ve got
