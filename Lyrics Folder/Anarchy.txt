[verse 1]

i’m dwindling

when it’s all out

her burden

never burned out

i brought it

light the match

set the fire

i sit defiled


[chorus]

bury me in 1965

i lost all hope on the first

praying for april

in an ash stained benz(o)

cardigan whipped in the mildest demeanour

lacking all the traits i had

that’s a natal

[bridge]

whoa

starting from the top

picking all the lock

oh, oh

geeking on your love again


[verse 2]

i love the way you give me some more

i can’t deny it

i’m a savage for the love

i can’t never get enough

am unsatisfying

like a hobby

taking my zs from these bees

and this honey

never can get enough oh oh

peep peep

down, i’m locked in a stop in a bottle

all the scene never gonna be the latch that we hold on to

whoa

no o+o+o

wild . . .


[chorus]

bury me in 1965

i lost all hope on the 1st

praying for april

in an ash stained benz(o)

cardigan whipped in the mildest demeanour

lacking all the traits i had

that’s a natal

[bridge]

whoa

starting from the top

picking all the lock

oh, oh

geeking on your love again


[outro]

never see the nutted

never see me nutting

never see the nutted

till scrub

grub dump

hop score

guys like that

never see the nutted

uh+oh

till scrub

grub dump

hop score

never see the nutted

eh eh ah
