[intro]

lies, they tell lies

ah oh+oh

don’t sell you’re that now

don’t be that way

don’t say that now


[verse 1]

clue in

thoth in

my head’s on me

it’s not leaving

i’m holding

i’m feeling holy

don’t you give me that

give me that

touching my pain

oh+oh

touch here my pain

when you whisper in my ear

i feel lot better

feel lot better

when you call my name

a filo wear on

i found you

my orbit from the start

my thought than i ever could plot

i front you

maybe from a dime

i lost my centre

searing the best of you

could be stuck on a couple photos

my h+ll

mile lost away

now i’m feeling

i’m not sure

currеnts bound to you

is it one or is it two

what’s my bond in the zoo

and em doors not on you
