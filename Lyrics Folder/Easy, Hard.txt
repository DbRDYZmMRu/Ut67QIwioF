[verse 1]

help me hold on to myself

hear me hold on to my attached

help me hold on to my love

my love don’t pay this much

my love don’t fail this way

every time i am here

i feel the same

every time i say words

doesn’t ring the same

it’s hard

oh i did that

easy, hard

living on

my heart don’t say you yearn now

my love don’t say you yearn

[outro]

tracing my tears

help, hold the air

minding my lane

sweating on dev

breathing, it cost the world

still, not the one to run
