[into]

oh oh

take me away now


[verse 1]

i’m feeling like a cardboard

sawed off

say i’m feeling like this got born

sewed on

um

she’s caught in me

cut into me

help a start

i keep holding on

ingot

leaving it on

my law is on another touch

and you let it go

all the time i make a saving learning

i can’t get my eye off you

you when you look that way

[bridge]

sipping, sipping

i can’t let it go now

ooh ooh

i’m bleeding, bleeding

i can’t let it go now

measure our darn love

i’m churning

churning

and it is coming down on you

on you

i’m churning

churning

and it is coming down on you


[verse 2]

is it enough now that i found heaven boy on you?

is it enough?

is it enough?

bleeding

will worn out

my th+rn

is your heart

my scorn

is everything

i’m hanging on at the leeway

to the scar

to the stop

that won’t let it go

my enough ain’t naught

ending all parade
