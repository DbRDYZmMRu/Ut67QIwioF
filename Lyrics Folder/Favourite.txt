[verse 1]

i’m just in my form

from a little town

a human farm

hop a beat

that’s my riddle round

i just had my cover blown

easy turn, busy mole

fettering on a noose

with the whistles blown

workaday hype

dim lit s’more

ends on something like this won’t bore

her too for lift

that’s her weekly strut

it’s me b+tting around

she’s never around

how have been?

happy on a couple like

yapping on the others

my mind niece in

not for the nutters

in stores for the orders

is how i dream when i clamp on the shoulders

it is half on deen

soul rhythm

it is just really over din

[chorus]

favourite, baby, tell me now

(favе, baby, tell me now)

do you see with the lights

(don’t you see with thе lights)

favourite, baby, tell me now

tell me now

ah!
