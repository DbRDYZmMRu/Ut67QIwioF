[verse 1]

well now i’m alone

i need no one

yeah i will be better on my own

i’ll be that lonely pole

you ‘on’t need to dance over me

just let me rest in peace

alone, alone

i am better alone

so long

you know

it never comes down

oh!

so my page reads i love you

feeling like it’s not in line

no affected darling

see you on

call me nand

feeling it’s a lovely song

i’m pouring up

i know that i’m a lonely wrong

you’re the only delay
