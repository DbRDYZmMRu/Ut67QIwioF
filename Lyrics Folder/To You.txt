[intro]

you know everything just seems to go really fast

it sucks

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

when they talk, they say

i wonder if they are ever getting back together

loving now when it’s cold

rudder off headed for your town

with this heart

it crawls, it never stops

hoping you know someday it will fly


[chorus]

to you

where it’s headed for the night

to you, it’s where it’s headed for the night

by your doorstep i will stand

say the words hoping you will see that

my love comes down, still remaining i hope


[verse 2]

i promised myself i’ll try again

telling myself those same wanton tales

doesn’t hurt, it isn’t scary

so this love shouldn’t be butchery

oh oh oh

i think that this will never ring the same

[chorus]

to you

where it’s headed for the night

to you, it’s where it’s headed for the night

by your doorstep i will stand

say the words hoping you will see that

my love comes down, still remaining i hope


[verse 3]

still remaining i hope

seal our fate in

in this fragrance of

something promising


[chorus]

to you

where it’s headed for the night

to you, it’s where it’s headed for the night

by your doorstep i will stand

say the words hoping you will see that

my love comes down, still remaining i hope
