[intro]

make a cast out my broken heart

you could keep it


[verse 1]

outta here!

cups sinked in tears

can’t get outta bed

lost in dose

it’s a misery

caught on toes

on an evening

how you like it when i’m f+cked up?

she’s toothless

tucking all the sheets

too neat

blot on my thought

clueless

ornaments on the wall

amus+m+nt

f+cking on the bed

it’s how i choose it

no she’s not a rider

she not one

doh+doh+doh my ditty

she bag one

doh+doh+doh my ditty

she bag one

no she’s not a rider

she not one

[bridge]

trail it on

trail it on

make a cast out ma broken heart

could keep it

done by a vermin

i can’t give it

trail it on

trail it on

make a cast out ma broken heart

could keep it

done by a vermin

i can’t give it


[instrumental]


[verse 2]

lull me to sleep

your motions

had my heart

trod erosions

hypnotized

swirling emotion

droll . .

you’re pretty

you’re yearning

hurting

i’m learning

and i’m trilling off it

and i’m trilling

make a cast (make a cast)

make a cast (broken heart)

broken heart (my broken heart)

only the vermin wins

make a cast out ma broken heart

you could keep it

done by a vermin

i couldn’t give it

tied to your trill

your wharf

[outro]

knocking down every door with my little beak

hunting down every thaw with my eagle peak

yeah i’m letting an ever tor in my brittle bill

morphine i bind you trump on my pain

karma that’s a wonk cue

tip on my pen

spelling out the cronk do

at the coast town rhythm

i’m really on you

trip for vain

not your plenum

took a name

broke the chain

dumbbell gains

ching!

trickling

d+ck in

pringles

l!cking

shank on my wink

culling the wind

banking on data

travelling with the barter

palling a perv

feeding on a fatal leaning to the gas

on a veto

took a fell

like a bait tow

oh thou!
