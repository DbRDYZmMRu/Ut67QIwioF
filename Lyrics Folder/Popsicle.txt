[chorus]

cubes in my coffee

popsicle icicle

i’ll take a blow for that smile

cubes in my coffee

popsicle icicle

i’ll take a blow for that smile

now she’s screaming

putrid


[verse 1]

she likes it when i’m silent

so i prise my heart out

seat her in its silence

a paste of a taste

now she’s pacing for a real taste

i’ma bend it

let her watch as it wrings out

[bridge]

tick tick

tick out

she never has it

a pert with a penchant for a distaste

with the hidden lights out

think i just hit the led

overflow beam on the box

i’ma wrong it out


[pre+chorus]

oh oh

popsiclе in my hand again

oh oh oh

i like it

l!ck it

l!ck it

l!ck it


[chorus]

cubes in my coffee

popsicle iciclе

i’ll take a blow for that smile

cubes in my coffee

popsicle icicle

i’ll take a blow for that smile

oh oh

now she’s screaming

putrid

oh oh oh

[verse 2]

her citrus hue got me seated on this ice

with a smirk slithery reeling on the sides

cheeky awe

reeling on

batty sore


[bridge]

i keep on bleating

bleat bleat

a pert with a penchant for a distaste

with the hidden lights out

think i just hit the led

overflow beam on the box

i’ma wrong it out


[pre+chorus]

oh oh

popsicle in my hand again

oh oh oh

i like it

l!ck it

l!ck it

l!ck it


[chorus]

cubes in my coffee

popsicle icicle

i’ll take a blow for that smile

cubes in my coffee

popsicle icicle

i’ll take a blow for that smile

oh oh

now she’s screaming

putrid

oh oh oh
