[chorus]

Bad decisions

Mad prescriptions

I butcher away in my mind

Bad decisions

Bad prescriptions

I butcher my mind

[verse 1]

Queue the pictures

Better before i die

I won’t ever know if it’s enough

Your pictures with bedspread all that

I don’t know when your answers will be enough

Take me down

Pairing my horror down

Take me down

Drag me to h ll

[bridge]

I think i woke up in a horror

In a valerate

I think i caught her back lab

[verse 2]

Saying everything doesn’t matter

I’ll wait at the door

Saying everything, that’s a man

Oh hеre we go again

I don’t know my name

Teens i callеd a fact

I’ll out you to live it all

[chorus]

Bad decisions

Mad prescriptions

I butcher my mind always

Bad decisions

Mad prescriptions

I butcher my mind always

[verse 3]

Siren, syringe, live it out

Don’t pick at us

Searing, siren, say you’re in

Live it out

Don’t peak when you’re down

Would it ever be enough?

(i’m dying in her hospital)

Would it ever be enough?

[bridge]

I think i woke up in a horror

In a valerate

I think i caught her back lab

[chorus]

Bad decisions

Mad prescriptions

I butcher away in my mind

Bad decisions

Bad prescriptions

I butcher my mind

[outro]

I butcher away in my mind

Bad decisions
