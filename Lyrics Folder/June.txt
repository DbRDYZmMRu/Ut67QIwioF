[bridge 1]

so, when it comes to gold

i don’t know what is soul

but i’m here though

and i’m here to grow

oh


[bridge 2]

we should figure it out

we should figure it out

instead of losing our cool

the solving of it

we should figure it out

we should figure it out

instead of losing our cool

it’s a mosh here

i think i’m the better of the two

she should better figure it out

figure

figure it out

she should figure it out

she think she better of the two

better of the two

she better figure it out

figure it out

we should figure it out

[chorus]

she thinks my love fit the wrong air

i think i love her, just the way

she thinks i’m in love with the wrong way

i think his creatures are that way

we should leap in the hassle

we should just let it lay

we should heap it on a nice song

girl just so immaculate

june let the reef off

don’t let the ring fall down

don’t let the roof off

june let the reef off

heavier


[verse 1]

waiting for

the rainfall

when it falls down

the rainfall

it’s your reign you fool

when it falls down

falls down

down

falls down

melee on
