[chorus]

i ain’t looking for you in a sea of faces

you should know i’m aboard dissonant of discord

when it rains, it pours

when i aim i score

i’m a bloke at it

for this dang reason you should know that i’m bored

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you

[bridge]

it’s my ego on my belt

i on’t even need to check

o+v+e+r y+o+u

i ‘on’t even owe you

ease off the pressure

like a parcel on my doorstep

it’s my ego on my belt

i on’t even need to check

o+v+e+r y+o+u

i ‘on’t even owe you

ease off the pressure

like a parcel on my doorstep


[verse 1]

is it the d+mn letters

penned headers

wrote a couple

hundred on double

pinned in your bubble

adduce sick

kettle of fish

juju joystick

that gold on the b.m.i

weighing in on your chair pride

[chorus]

i ain’t looking for you in a sea of faces

you should know i’m aboard dissonant of discord

when it rains, it pours

when i aim i score

i’m a bloke at it

for this dang reason you should know that i’m bored

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you


[bridge]

it’s my ego on my belt

i on’t even need to check

o+v+e+r y+o+u

i ‘on’t even owe you

ease off the pressure

like a parcel on my doorstep

it’s my ego on my belt

i on’t even need to check

o+v+e+r y+o+u

i ‘on’t even owe you

ease off the pressure

like a parcel on my doorstep

[verse 2]

you know i was just going through

your pictures and

(yeah, i really do you know)

i really wish you were

you were looking this cute nowadays

(ah ah ah ah)

and ah . . . make it

(yeah yeah)

you know spank as you used to

yeah (i’m over you though)


[chorus]

i ain’t looking for you in a sea of faces

you should know i’m aboard dissonant of discord

when it rains, it pours

when i aim i score

i’m a bloke at it

for this dang reason you should know that i’m bored

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you

(this is the heartbreak song you asked for)

i’m like dang it

i’m bored i’m bored and i’m over you

(didn’t break my heart, i’m over you)


[outro]

it’s my ego on my belt

it’s my ego on my belt

it’s my ego on my belt

i on’t even need to check
