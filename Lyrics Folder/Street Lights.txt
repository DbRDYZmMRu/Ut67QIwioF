[intro]

tell me what you see with the sh+tty eyes

armed with a taser

i’m calling but you’re not hearing

the walls spell your years

say we sealing

it was veel nine

i see none

how long are you holding on to this


[verse 1]

my tears falling

they don’t . . .

be here now

saying the year that they hold

homie the left i do

and i know it hurts to feel low

when it sucks still

to be in love

a call away

it tears, veils, the day

tell me what you see with the street light

cos i don’t see

tell me what you still see with the street lights

is it that i don’t see

[verse 2]

so it started with the familiar

wе just started from the:

all thesе is bison

and i was he+rs+ing

ignore the swap team

it’s kissing in the h+ll we are in

i don’t really know

how it goes

if it is true

or it is wrong

i just feel

that i am here

and i know

how i’m goad

you who is beta

you who is better

her row better

you will steer

handle your stool in

and i feel that i’m better

doesn’t matter

i’m a kong

happy betting

here they say

doesn’t matter

how it goes

how it goes

how it goes

cosmic hull

does he still hurt

does he do

my love always buying

give me a clue

i don’t really know if it is true

means i ain’t laying on the best of me

failing the year i am not deceiving

the calling, and praying that i take all the doors

zip in on her

dumb brain out here

when it is no when i am busy

to the day when i frock my head in known

hope you are the anecdote

the naniq thaws

two worlds apart

two worlds, a prose

i’m mowing my conscience

does he feast

does he riddle
