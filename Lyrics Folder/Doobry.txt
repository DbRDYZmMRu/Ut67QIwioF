[intro]

uh+oh


[chorus]

doobry here, doobry

my time lorn

doobry here, doobry

my time gone

can i get it back

can i get it back here home

cannot get it back

can you get back

doobry, doobry here

cannot get it back

doobry, doobry here

cannot get it back

[verse 1]

talk to me

hidden behind a mulling pint

bore to me

wincing in audible thought

lily had a birthday

i was found missing

grace was afforded

i couldn’t make the sale

maybe i do

i do, i do

maybe i do

i do, i do, i do


[chorus]

doobry here, doobry

my time lorn

doobry here, doobry

my time gone

can i get it back

can i get it back here home

cannot get it back

can you get back

doobry, doobry here

cannot get it back

doobry, doobry here

cannot get it back
