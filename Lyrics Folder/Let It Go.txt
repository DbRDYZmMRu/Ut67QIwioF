[verse 1]

sometimes i wish i could hear the whisper

hold on to myself, not let go

sometimes i don’t wanna be heavier

i just want these thousands emotions

being the same

do you know what i mean

i mean just being here all day

i don’t want nothing new

i just wanna see my girl

better than a dew

brighter than the sun

i know nothing hurts that way

but i’ll be better as his son

better with the moon

better like i could have everything

bettеr, better, bettеr


[chorus]

but sometimes i just want you to let me go

i don’t wanna to play these games

i just want you to let me go

i don’t want to feel this way

would you let me go

i feel so better when i’m on my own

i wish i could prove and do some more

[verse 2]

faster at saying a lie

i’m bad at keeping my dirty tracks

no, you come for it

oh oh

come merry y’all

oh oh

lost in this end of the world

and i don’t know where is home

maybe it’s seeing you scold

(seeing you scold)

would i let it go

(let it go)

my ears on fire

let it go

(let it go)

my girl accosting me

would i let it go

(let it go) 


[outro]

running from my letting it go

hold my goal

letting it go

how long can i let it go
