[intro]

hi, hi

do you hear me?


[bridge]

do we ever get together?

do we ever get together?

do we ever say our byes looking in our eyes?

doing it is alright


[chorus]

you should be my lover

you should be my lover

you!

you should be my lover

don’t you hear it

you should be my lover


[verse 1]

i’m with you again

writing a song again

saying the leaf has fallen

and it’s happened i’m here again

come giving me love

stun, putting me on

accord, giddy on turn

she’s just the way

higher before, a loan on me

[bridge]

do we ever get together?

do we ever get together?

do we ever say our byes looking in our eyes?

doing it is alright


[chorus]

you should be my lover

you should be my lover

you!

you should be my lover

don’t you hear it

you should be my lover


[verse 2]

again, and again

we go through these tears

over the text i never sent

and thoughts i never had

don’t make it hard

only comes this time of the year

in a minute it is gone

i should have known that


[bridge]

do we ever get together?

do we ever get together?

do we ever say our byes looking in our eyes?

doing it is alright

[chorus]

you should be my lover

you should be my lover

you!

you should be my lover

don’t you hear it

you should be my lover
