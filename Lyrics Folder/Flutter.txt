[intro]

oh oh oh oh

[chorus]

trip stunt

real nut

waterloo

lolly gauge

in my head

where it ends

i’m never gone

in the reeling

my sorrows ends on the page

no face for the sunny days

[verse i]

i’ll be fine

never real, now i am

and she’ll get this rhyme

and it feels its all right

when am here it’s all right

when you’re near i feel all right

i’ll be fine now

yeah, it is all right

and no o+o way that i am going back

no way its dime

come save it off

i’m feeling lorn

oh take away the lake

[chorus]
