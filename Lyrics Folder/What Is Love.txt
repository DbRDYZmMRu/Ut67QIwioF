[verse 1]

yeah i really f+cking loved her

from the very start

threw my heart at the bottom of the mosh pit

oh sh+t!

shе’s a bandit

left my heart all bandaged up

no! i can’t f+cking stand it

i ‘on’t еven understand it

how you got me tangled in this mess (mess!)

i feel like an astronaut at the bottom of the sea (bottom of the sea)

you broke my heart, still you told me we gonna see (we gonna see)

miss dangerous

b+tch satan sent

broke my heart

then left me in the dirt (left me in the dirt)

d+mn i thought you were heaven sent

[verse 2]

girl i gave you everything

still, you left me by the wayside (wayside)

swore, it was deeper than your waistline

more than the facetimes

to my chagrin, you were out here sh+gging other guys

told you i was gonna get it

every other time you smiled at me

it felt disconnected

something like a severed connection

it was so pretentious

now i know you’re not the one
