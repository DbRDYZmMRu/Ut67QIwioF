[intro]

for you, i’ll try

mine, it’s not a coincidence

hi, take my hand


[verse 1]

my love is not going nowhere

and this time, it’s not ticking

a nod in my face

i’m sitting on this

i’m picking it out

i’m freaking over this

oh, take notes

take this down

it’s going down

my grain is up and it is seaming in

simile, simmering


[bridge]

high old time

(play here)

halo, while your time

pining this

play here all the time

high old time

(girlie, girlie)

with you

(pine)

is the best side

i want you by my side

(side)

(by my side)

[verse 2]

high old time

(high old time)

be on time

(be on time)

we should not re+recline

i just want you lover

don’t be a sly

(obvious twinkle)

i can’t look at the sky

long day now

(i can’t look at the sky, long day now)

i can be what side

oh

he’s charted

it’s f+cked up

i kicking stones, all the time

(up in the air)

it doesn’t ever change

not around here, not in my level

not in my bedroom

not when i’m out

or wherever . . .

i’m a man in my head

tall to you

[outro]

talk, talk

back, i’ll never go out of luck

(nowhere)

you should know girl

tee this up, cool pretty, you are out

the vain in touch

hyena the seed above it

i owe it to a receipt

i’m not old enough
