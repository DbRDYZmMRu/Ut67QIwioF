[intro]

i’m your only lover you say

i’m that only brother you pay

all mind to, i’ll die too


[verse 1]

i hear you

fill me in closer

wassail, oh

who is clark kent

because i am reeling too hard

feeling too hurt


[bridge]

down with me, down with me

and i’ll ride forever

down with me, down with me

i’ll ride forever


[verse 2]

i keep trying but i can’t lift this

(can’t lift it)

oh, it’s an anvil on my hope

(on my hope)

it’s an anvil on my hope

my hope, my hope

[chorus]

i’m your only lover you say

i’m that brother you say

you’ll pay all mind to

and i said, i’ll die too

i’ll die too


[verse 3]

money on my mind

(it’s money on my mind)

gusto for my line

(money on my mind)

my line of love

(money on my mind)

my love for a girl, a lie

(money on my mind)

if that’s not with you included

i don’t know what’s to leave for grooving

what is there to prove

my girl too tough

is there not enough ode

burning call credit


[outro]

i’m that brother

(i’m the brother)

i’m that lover

(i’m the lover)

i’m that lover you say

(i’m the lover)

i’m that brother

(she dowelling me, yo)

and i’ll die

(i could be out at the door)

die for you

it is my pride

call me out whole

piece of a man
