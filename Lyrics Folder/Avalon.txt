[verse 1]

cliff

pledge at the end of my bachelorhood

be a man past the boy he was

paris, got me dangling from wishing on a certain fairy

fair he goes

here’s a rose

duty on a dollar spray

won’t you love to hear me say


[chorus]

lurid, movie, won’t you watch it play

lurid, movie, won’t you watch it play


[verse 2]

i can’t get enough of this

losing my mind just to take a couple tavern

looking my name

(hilton)

oh make it serious, like a list of mono my year

(am i here?)

surreal one in silk in

hurry through the pavement

i want to seek your avalon


[outro]

mehn i don’t really know what’s really changed

apart from getting sеrious with a lady

that sh+t half sucks and puts a lot of bulk on you
