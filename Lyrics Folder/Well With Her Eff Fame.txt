[intro]

yeah!

now

(dog barking)

hmm


[chorus]

say it’s the same

but we loved in different ways

say it’s the same

but we loved in different ways

you make it rain

out the wall whoa whoa whoa

you make it rain

outta control

leave it all low

leave it all in the past

leave it all laying girl

leave it all in the past

[verse 1]

a smear

hides in the past

seething there’s another way

it’s another day

seething it’s another day

it’s another page of disaster

she came back with me after

and i told her i got anothеr mrs

bathing all my wishes all red

ah!

well with hеr eff fame


[chorus]

say it’s the same

but we loved in different ways

say it’s the same

but we loved in different ways

you make it rain

out the wall whoa whoa whoa

you make it rain

outta control

leave it all low

leave it all in the past

leave it all laying girl

leave it all in the past

a smear

hides in the past
