[verse 1]

and it goes

and it goes

summer times on the road

where did my clothes go

i feel that i’m my own

bother and troubles

i feel that i’m my own hubble

and i’m looking at your

body, body, body girl

out there in outer sp+ce

you dazzle me

and i can’t

get you out of

out of my mind


[verse 2]

how you look so beautiful

(beautiful)

how you’re looking so beautiful

(beautiful)

how you were well to know

i must be blind

(i’m blind)

i know for sure

i must be on my last drive

and i’m hitting your way

your way, your way

[verse 3]

girl therapy

day your way will be the last cline

there’s no where further from this

further from you

i see nothing further from you

arriving at your home

i’ll find your place

oh+oh

i’ll find your address

and say i’m at the way
