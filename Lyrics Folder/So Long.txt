[intro]

hey

i can’t feel my self

no, no, no

i can’t feel my self

no

if i can’t be myself

no

i can’t see this h+ll

no

i can’t see this h+ll

[verse 1]

tell me what you feel

i can see he’s writing

so he real

tell me what you feel

my head keeps going in another direction

i feel healed

does it for you

does, his radio

servile was a thrill

d+mn my emotions are real

barred, i feel d+mn barred from your love

barred, i’m feeling d+mn barred from your love

that means something is obstructing

that was so bland, took in all of my culprits

i’m not on my laud

it’s enough with it

it’s enough with it

it’s enough with it

i need a drink

i need to settle down

the heat is getting to mе

from my level around

and the dеvil is up around

he’s never coming round

i’m just saying that i need some water

i can feel it

i can feel it

i can feel it

the devil is roaming around

[verse 2]

back to my life

they thought i never had

now i’m doing what i f+cking love

dead broke sitting on a chair that i never broke

and it’s my bed, no, it’s not yours

yo, it’s my head, no, it’s not yours

yes, it is my bread

d+mn, i’m going on my way

i’m going on my way

i’m saying bye+bye

so long

or poring me

sell me, where the line

maybe, that’s when i’m on your tv

and you see now, on the clear view

no oh, the colours feel drawn

no oh, the volume is still down

no oh, i can’t really hear you

no oh, i mean so long


[outro]

yeah, it’s your boy

frith hilton

i’m out
