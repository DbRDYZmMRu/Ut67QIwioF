[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

there are lots of pretty girls in here

there is fragrance in the air

i’m bidding my time

and though i’m coming for a girl

crease in my lines

(i need to write on this)

biggy, not afraid though

seeking, not a g+y here

how she tells me that

she’ll never get my freight in

i’m in her paper

likened to savers

i get a car

she tell me i’m not fair

told her, girl, that sh+t is not fitting


[bridge]

and i her try

looking in my face

in the f+cking amount of time

i try

saying everything i am

i’m out hеre

[verse 2]

motherf+ckers wanna hold mе down

like it’s not time to be gourmet

i don’t even know

ain’t no f+ckers around

that’s the darkest

it’s me on the mic

cos i won’t let it b rule

and i’m skipping on my words

like i’m skipping docks

but n0body says his stocks ever got her

i’m liking it

cos i gotta aim this shot

shots at the back of my mind

like door on menace

fin in up, cornmeals

all i ever had are darts

come up higher, i say to myself

why, we’re grinding harder

i’m looking at myself

fishing out mummed thoughts

if they stay true

they will resonate with me

ace in on my son

a man who really cares

for these thoughts, mum louder

if i fail, that’s my dot to her

if i rise, that’s my fish

the whole haircut, know that’s my official

(laughter)

that’s my fish

yeah, that’s my fish

if i ride, that’s my fish

how i f+cking go
