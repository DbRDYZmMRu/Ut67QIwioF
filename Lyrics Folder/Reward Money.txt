[intro]

fresh boy chilling

blame it on my neck


[verse 1]

do i ever have to say something

does it ever have to mean anything

when i call my names

do i go out saying that i have a new face

do i meet dud with sale

do i give a good tale

i keep asking

my heavy well rote soul

i let it go

no i let it go

i don’t give a goal

no, no


[verse 2]

big in on my verse i carve it

i give you, you have your yaff

part of it

how i care for every +rs+nal part of it

now my love has started having orders

giving up unmanned

like it, i get it, i in rave, i rev it

she knows, i never come up

no on blank, it’s not on dreg

that zit, i grit it

my f+cking big figure

is all i’m going revving for, neat

this never got me in

never got me an earn

how you ever feel

once your body gives you a smile

voices in my head

they ain’t never made me filled

[verse 3]

i like your m

i’m west, you see me now

i should never have found

ticking out everything

it’s all in the past

shrieking in all the quells

listen, i’m not a fighter

i get it, my talk is here for a kite

linking at my call

my nest is not your pad

looking at my ex

i think i did that

i figure it out like a mavin

i could get her to talk

i could give her her parting

musing out

easy on the hour

here’s an age

just o make me feel

bet on power

i can give her d+ck

like here’s another mouth

is that a mild diss

i get the clouts

cram, make a nick for sound

easy f

like do it or do it with twines

do it hard

bigger bad
