[intro]

spell it

fresh boy chilling

girl, i need you to spell it


[verse 1]

she’s been asking me to spell it out

i’ve been drinking so much about my heart aches

she’s been asking about my bed time

i’ve been asking if she’ll help with stories

i’m a baby with a broken heart

calling to a girl who’s got her own baby

i’m a grown man

hoping one day i’ll say that

i’ll be laughing now

(laughter)

i just need my mood out of here

i don’t want to feel so h+rny

i just need a bed time story

can’t you help me out of this


[bridge]

figures, in my head

acting so greedy

i say god is greedy

i was talking about how some of my foes make some cash

[verse 2]

i need it now

in a funk, care pack out of here, the door

with this, she says she wants a rendition

i just say, just want s+x

is it too much, whеn love is not in my head

about to sell it out

cash at thе doorstep, never gave it out

i’ve been the best

maybe i’m just in love


[verse 3]

with this creative ass of mine

i’ll be tailing everywhere where they say love hurts

i lose everytime when this heart weighs heavier

hades should hold me home

i need more lovers

i just need more lovers

with hearts heavier than anvils

yeah
