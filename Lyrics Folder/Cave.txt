[intro]

i’m lost in the cave

of everything that you do


[verse 1]

i’m bothered am i gonna fall

i’m bothered

i might try to murder a shade

is it right if i don’t buy it

is it right if i’m on my berth

i need to say something

bite it on my own

i need to say something

call it out for what it is

i get it every time

my love is not tall or bien


[verse 2]

dump it on you

i love it

how you call my name

sail with you

i love how you get around

baby, don’t you ever say i’m bothering

all ready

am i enough furor if we’re ready

to you ever say

what’s your riding theme

do you ever ever say

maybe this doesn’t count

ah

i need, i need

you, more than i did yesterday

i need, i need

more than i did before

count to four

let’s take all this time to undo

all the, all the bust

of imminence

oh

of our heavier rust

back to preference

i’m lost in your conscience

tuck in, talking

talking over how you do

talking over how you do

could love me don’t you
