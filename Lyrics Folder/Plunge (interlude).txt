[ verse 1 ]

i hope you had fun

but you knew girl

it’s in your thighs

i hope you get drunk

while am sailing on another shelf

this pills don’t count

it’s because you got me dead

i’ll be your better

if you only heard

how i choked

every time you told me you love me

how i plot every time i thought i had it

something from me make you chose me

now i’m feeling like i can’t get enough of it

i can’t

i can’t

i can’t

get enough of it

you just plunged for nothing girl

but it’ll be fine
