[intro]

yeah!


[refrain]

uh!

h+llo

it was you

but does it add up (up)

h+llo

buzzing

girl we stay right up

my loves in you love

so hyped up

my feeling running on her love like drop+top

tryna get back into my skin

wrapped up

bop stop

since your rap up

her pinch and i get back in my skin

door stop, stop, stop, snap

gotta tell me how it d+mn goes

i think i’m living it up wretched up

anything you need up

all your low, highs didn’t get to me

like the top when it is just you and i?

just you and i

the stall with these words don’t ever pin me down

bust on your third toe loud

wouldn’t even tell me

got a b+tch a valve

she could be mine

if she not just, to take choo (jimmy choo)

lost in this corridor drawed in

with a lime juice in my cup

save the club issues
