[intro]

sleazy been the bit

past the patch slew


[verse 1]

money, money, money

his resolve

tonic, con nick

garlic, deep retorts

be on the surf

got a bidding in the dot

i told her that

i will take her to the dance

she said stop

call myself a tailor

but he never call a take

so i tape my been a yap

winning, started picking on you

or a kid, my fawn raining

it’s a taurine

but she never get it right

to ma, dim, a witted

but i’m never a dove with it

i’m always on my sh+t

that’s something like a business

and she’s always like steps ahead

i’m thе swan in the water

who’ll nevеr you know

have a bath

do i ever do

even when the water is frozen

i’m still floating

it is just distend

that makes me

i feel like it’s a tossing

that will take me

out of this mind of mine

like honey he is not fading

it’s just perspective

my fair oh knee nab

i’m taking the needed

over when they announce

sinking it off

this begging, it is

(laughter)

oh my gawd
