[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

has it been a minute

since i had a even digit running through my mind

coming up with numbers

how to reach you

having thoughts about another picture

trifling man you see the way

that i leave it undecided


[chorus]

heartbeat

love gives

what i’ve got

in night a kid singing

i don’t know how to spell

l+o+v+e y+o+u

i think i still owe you


[verse 2]

love abandoned

love in a barn, i think i had a garden

i was banned, now they say ghetto foetus

what’s the farthest meme in here girl

i can’t take my hands off mine

can’t take my hands off mine

[chorus]

heartbeat

love gives

what i’ve got

in night a kid singing

i don’t know how to spell

l+o+v+e y+o+u

i think i still owe you
