[chorus]

can i paint the pace a little down

for my heart has lost

its taste for this rhythm

can i paint the pace a little down

’cause my heart has lost

its taste for this rhythm


[verse 1]

it’s bringing me down everything

call it how i take the worst straw

picking on my thoughts

for something more edible

waiting here it suck

you suck

every other time, why won’t i try harder

my heart is a mess when you’re around

and it frowns and it frowns at

my heart says something wrong every time


[bridge]

can i paint the pace a . . .


[verse 2]

come tell me that i could be bеtter

come tell mе my life could turn down better

ken is fine, it’s never a fight

when it’s fine

it’s only in sharing

forever, would i ever let it go

whenever i feel it picking on my thoughts

picking on my worst

have i ever had another thought

and i mean for the worst

[outro]

so i saw a man sleeping outside

and i wondered it could be my bedroom

i have felt the room
