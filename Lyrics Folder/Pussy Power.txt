(p+ssy power)

it’s so strange

(so strange)

it’s so meaningless

i’m weak

(i’m weak)

i always go for glory all the time


[verse 1]

my mind lost a call

so he’s on a girl

my mind is on a girl

such, her calls

(such, her calls)

would you come around, she pours

(pour)

with her lips down the dot

i only hope she reads my godd+mn words

(my godd+mn words)

(oh)

when she spins, it’s like orders

(oh)

my norse nurse

(brevity)

some will like her son

i love, well the boy is . .

(yeah)

and i’ll probably love her boy

and i’m not talking the love whеn you stun

(handsome)

[verse 2]

spiel, all i evеr do is spit

(spit)

talk of a lean on pill

(pills)

oh+oh+oh

(parry)

i’m not sure if this is gonna end

it started

(it started)

i’m just loving your stove when you on

when you say it is my godd+mn level of gee count

(woo)

(ah+ah)

(yo)

(oh+oh)

i’m just saying how i’m feeling on this

(oh+oh)

i’m heavy on your deep pit

like this sopping week

(every time)

and i’m not sending a wave

i’m just saying i’m in the indie

(ill)

heir of my fore gale

list of the d+cks you hurt

(d+ck you hurt)

[outro]

it is all in the details

when you look at me

feel like i’m a sinner

i ‘on’t really know

(know)

if this is something good

(good)

her wish that i’m lost in blind

(fold)

coal all again

i know this her game

i just really know i lost my godd+mn mind

(godd+mn mind)

when i’m peeled on my phone

and i’m out there in the margin
