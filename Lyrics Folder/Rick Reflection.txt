[intro]

fresh boy chilling

i am waking up

with a different feeling

in my heart, in my body

yeah, it’s a different vibe

i hear swats


[chorus]

i’m with admission

laughing with ambition

oh rick reflection

oh look at my mission

i get you all the time

all the time


[verse 1]

i wake up

with a different feeling

not a sweat

that was on my insecurities

he’ll live by your son coming up

in a spellbook

the way you prep my head

and i feel that

i got a crop

with his step, puree sup

i get a feeling

i’m not amnesia aging

i ain’t got a legion

ah oh

i get a feeling

i’m in, he’s healing

i am in remission

ah oh

[verse 2]

habit ambition

all time emission

locked in on what you reaching for

as you fall

lest your four walls

i get in, on advancе

i’m with ambition

hope for recognition

hopeful gеneration

i’m a new me

hoping to help you in fall

oh how you farrow


[verse 3]

two picks

looking for a next stick

i just gotta reveal

that i follow everytime

i wallow in it everytime

how do i get my heir

her spade

i can’t have my whim

i can’t have her way

she just gotta stay

that is your bill on mine

idol be mine

i’ve been nosy

out of my head in a slippery rate

your sh+t i’m revering

affirming is deceiving

there is just taylor in my head

and that means

that i’m revealing it up

[outro]

weighted mission

often with ambition

au fait that’s your reason

and she told me dear she said ed

i look better, when i’m with it

and that could mean that

eye on her ignition

awful when i’m b+tching

now with a patent to dreaming

and that could mean that i’m in the low hem

and i’m hoping that she with it

oh oh
