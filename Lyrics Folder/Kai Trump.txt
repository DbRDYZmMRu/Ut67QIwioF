[intro]

yeah

skrr

bet the day, you’re yum

fresh boy chilling

does my breath feel in here?


[verse 1]

at times i think to myself

do i get a chance, take you out

when i’m at my bed, i’m at the edge

oh my legs don’t touch the floor

it’s how i feel

all these thoughts in my head, got me off the flaw

looking high, can i ever touch your flaw

(so be it, i’m in love if you’re rare)


[bridge]

i just need a day with you

just the moments to tell you that

you’re beautiful

you’re so beautiful


[chorus]

i would say it a thousand times

if it needs to be said that way

the sky could come down

it still means the same

you’re one of the best smiles i ever saw

and i’m all over it

all over again like a thousand times in my head

oh i’m all over it

a thousand times in my head

[verse 2]

so we go

we’ll get a place open, i prefer la tonight in my head

it’s cos of you, how you do it

how you crank a smile

i don’t really know how this world could ever be the same without you

manky, you got me crucifying all my l+st


[bridge]

i just need a day with you

just the moments to tell you that

you’re beautiful

you’re so beautiful


[chorus]

i would say it a thousand times

if it needs to be said that way

the sky could come down

it still means the same

you’re one of the best smiles i ever saw

and i’m all over it

all over again like a thousand times in my head

oh i’m all over it

a thousand times in my head


[outro]

how do i ever feel the way

oh no

when you make it so different
