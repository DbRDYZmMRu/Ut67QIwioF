[intro]

way!

i just can breathe in

i just came to say that

you should let me go

oh you got me in your clutch

nothing is bring this around

not even the world can take this down

i’m lauding your touch girl

l+i+l+i

l+i+l+y

i’m feeling like this is not even gon’ be the regular

my heart’s on you

my heart’s on you

[verse 1]

toiling it goes

my love composed

i took a bolt

and i screwed it in

and i levelled it in

my love is not going back this time

i should take it out

say i want my time

my love is not going back this time

i’m holding on

like a road on

see me on

like gold

oh oh oh

my love is not here (and it goes, and it goes)

for the pose

no, i’m all in


[chorus]

i just can brеathe in

i just came to say that

you should let mе go

oh you got me in your clutch

l+i+l+i

l+i+l+y

i’m feeling like this is not even gon’ be the regular

my heart’s on you

my heart’s on you

[verse 2]

you should take it back

the guise on the mist

you should take it back

the doubt on the love

how does a lead expand?

does it get a bad one?

how does it get returned

‘tis love . . . why you hurting?

we should wave our flags

and make out our sodden

order

recording in


[chorus]

i just can breathe in

i just came to say that

you should let me go

oh you got me in your clutch

l+i+l+i

l+i+l+y

i’m feeling like this is not even gon’ be the regular

my heart’s on you

my heart’s on you


[outro]

my heart’s on you

something like hurting

my heart’s on you

something like a broken shape

[laughter]

a lily . .
