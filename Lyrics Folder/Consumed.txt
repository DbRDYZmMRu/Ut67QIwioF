[intro]

mourning

and it’s morning

my turning

soils my timing

hold me in


[chorus]

if i told you this was the end

would you pull me back from the ash

kiss me goodbye

my heart of gold my ride or die

cos now i know

it’s better that you let me go

i won’t try and mess with your head (mess with your head)

i just pray that you can forgive (you can forgive)

forget the past

i want you never looking back

go on alone

it’s better that you let me go

[verse 1]

how you consumed my heart

got me shut off miles away

terminal dead lines

i can’t get you arms way

h+llo! h+llo!

bereft oh my cardio+

lethargic whеn i’m next to you

kiss me goodbye

my ridе or die

let me know

let me know

how you really feel

i can’t let you go

let you go

i got nothing real

if this ain’t about us

then why does my heart tune in love

if this can’t save us

sold it all to dust


[pre+chorus]

ticking

ticking (and it says)

i can’t get my mind right (i am melting on, i am melting on)

ticking

ticking (and it says)

i can’t get my mind right (i am melting on, i am melting on)

[chorus]

if i told you this was the end

would you pull me back from the ash

kiss me goodbye

my heart of gold my ride or die

cos now i know

it’s better that you let me go

i won’t try and mess with your head (mess with your head)

i just pray that you can forgive (you can forgive)

forget the past

i want you never looking back

go on alone

it’s better that you let me go


[verse 2]

oh oh

can’t say no

my thoughts go

leaving me

alone alone

on the floor

when i’m not

never sated

all my love

the issues

inebriated (natch!)

d+mning all the not enough to quail my morn duds

stir .

a arm solved on the sorry

a cut that says more than now than an all over

a zombie on your weather

[pre+chorus]

ticking

ticking (and it says)

i can’t get my mind right (i am melting on, i am melting on)

ticking

ticking (and it says)

i can’t get my mind right (i am melting on, i am melting on)


[chorus]

if i told you this was the end

would you pull me back from the ash

kiss me goodbye

my heart of gold my ride or die

cos now i know

it’s better that you let me go

i won’t try and mess with your head (mess with your head)

i just pray that you can forgive (you can forgive)

forget the past

i want you never looking back

go on alone

it’s better that you let me go
