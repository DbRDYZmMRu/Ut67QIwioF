[intro]

(cl!cking)

yeah

i just felt i had to record this

cos i always forget sh+t all the time

(clears throat)

hold me down with that sh+t tomorrow

you know

just have a go

the way it visually goes

that’s . . . 

with the probable virtual machine in the works

[verse 1]

and i’m still here the best ambrosia for these girls

and taylor still gets it

hold up

ain’t no but

everybody wants me on something different

so i guess i’ma go for this sh+t

you want to be on that sh+t now

lead . . . like like

f+ck all these sh+t ’em n+ggers be saying

i’m still back with these words

and they know he isn’t playing

my man all freaking

rеal . . . all seen

and i’m still on this f+cking reel lotion

i feel like taylor hears me, whеn i spit the d+mn bars

but i’m not that man

i’m the d+mn man with the nice shoe

i’m still chilling like i got no clues

and my love still on no prove

no period

no prude

if go on this sh+t

they say i talk too much

and if i pick the ball up

they say he works too much

talk to me when you’re feeling nice

too many words in my head it’s feeling like a flow

but i’m not down for this sh+t

i might just pick my pen up and write some sh+t

cos, it goes better that way

flows better

talking to my girl like she was my ex

talking to her head

she’ll never catch me with a brexit

like deal

like

court enough

court enough

cutting off all my f+cking overt sieve

and i’ll still go with the same sh+t all the time

and she know a boy drained out

but i knock, knocked “knock knock”

i keep knocking on this d+mn sh+t

keep holding back on my old sh+t

i’m still buying down all my old beats

yeah . .

(sn+ggering)

[verse 2]

yeah, yeah, yeah

who is lame in this b+tch?

who is tryna act like they got crave in this b+tch?

cos i ain’t got no juice

cos i ain’t got no juice

some walking around with a frown

acting like i got a motherf+cker a round

i’m not even down for the f+cking bounce

bounce, bounce, bounce

still dancing with a step that looks simpler

eh!

wanna talk to me

better talk words

cos i don’t talk willing with the +rs+ accent

but i might just pick up the bar i’ve seen

yeah! took her out the while

n+gga feeling like it’s not about the wile

h, while they chase with the poems or the rap

but i’m not down for that

so you better get it right cos

(derision)

i’ma write on this sh+t you know

just to feel good with your own

i guess it’s time you know

to say sh+t you know

more!

i’ma write on this sh+t

like i write every time anyway

look how he be acting like he can’t write on this sh+t

you li’l trifle b+tch

(cl!cking)
