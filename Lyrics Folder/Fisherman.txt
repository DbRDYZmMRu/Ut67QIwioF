[verse 1]

Hey, when she dance

She has that back do a little bit of wiggle, lead boo

I’m back at the club

(fresh boy chilling)

And i’m stuck with the men who are drinking

[chorus]

Fisherman, fisherman

She has a i love you

Written all over of her face

Cos i got my bands up

And i dropped off

This whip

When i step in the club

I’m like a million wigs

[bridge]

I’m judging all these n ggers

So they can’t stand my fang

No oh, they can’t stand me here

[chorus]

Fisherman, fisherman

She has a i love you

Written all over of her face

Cos i got my bands up

And i droppеd off

This whip

When i step in the club

I’m likе a million wigs

[bridge]

I’m judging all these n ggers

So they can’t stand my fang

No oh, they can’t stand me here

[verse 2]

Looking real fly

Like i’m dating lisa

I’ll be a rockstar

Cos i’m outta sp ce

About this bass

When she hears it

She’s a sauce, her face

[chorus]

Fisherman, fisherman

She has a i love you

Written all over of her face

Cos i got my bands up

And i dropped off

This whip

When i step in the club

I’m like a million wigs
