[verse 1]

hey, when she dance

she has that back do a little bit of wiggle, lead boo

i’m back at the club

(fresh boy chilling)

and i’m stuck with the men who are drinking


[chorus]

fisherman, fisherman

she has a i love you

written all over of her face

cos i got my bands up

and i dropped off

this whip

when i step in the club

i’m like a million wigs


[bridge]

i’m judging all these n+ggers

so they can’t stand my fang

no oh, they can’t stand me here


[chorus]

fisherman, fisherman

she has a i love you

written all over of her face

cos i got my bands up

and i droppеd off

this whip

when i step in the club

i’m likе a million wigs

[bridge]

i’m judging all these n+ggers

so they can’t stand my fang

no oh, they can’t stand me here


[verse 2]

looking real fly

like i’m dating lisa

i’ll be a rockstar

cos i’m outta sp+ce

about this bass

when she hears it

she’s a sauce, her face


[chorus]

fisherman, fisherman

she has a i love you

written all over of her face

cos i got my bands up

and i dropped off

this whip

when i step in the club

i’m like a million wigs
