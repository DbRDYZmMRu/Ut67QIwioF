[intro]

fresh boy chilling

oh oh oh oh


[chorus]

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish


[bridge]

i get the runtime

you get the uptime

making up for downtimes

i can not pr+nounce frowns

i met you at the hem of mayhem

car park with a backdrop fleeting


[verse 1]

i think it’s freeing

i make me feel so feverish

i can’t fill in on a nap on no one

oh woah

[bridge]

i get the runtime

you get the uptime

making up for downtimes

i can not pr+nounce my frowns

i met you at the hem of mayhem

car park with a backdrop fleeting


[chorus]

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish


[verse 2]

wishing on a fetter falling in place

quizzing our affair, i fear it’s you, you

hopping undercover

(hopping undercover)

looking for what other

(looking for what other)

now i’m wishing, and i’m pacing

and i’m dancing with my heart

looking for her fault

i think i’ll finally afford her

i’ve been dancing, i’ve been calling

looking for it, her heart linked to another

[chorus]

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish

scripting tweezers

applish feverish

ambling in nix

hackling in the peevish


[verse 3]

my problems dress the same

looking for whodunit hey

think i might be a crescent

looking like he’s gonna paint

what’s your name

her k!ll will say

i’ll fade away with leaves

fade away with leaves

d+mn it, another day comes

fade away with leaves
