[intro]

how you gonna tell me

that you need it

how you gonna tell me

that you miss it

how you gonna tell me

that you miss me

how you gonna tell me

that you need it


[verse 1]

we go through these conversations

i tell you how i feel

you say you missed at the mirror

the way you feel

the hush

all you healed

mine still stays fettered

holly’s holocene

we’re fairing

i’m that fairy lean

fill up, if we’re evading

[bridge]

faulting, it’s your forte


[chorus]

how you gonna tell me

that you need it

oh h+ll

it’s still the same thing

i’ll still say

you are the reason for our fall

how you gonna tell mе

that you need it

oh h+ll

it’s still the same thing

i’ll still say

you arе the reason for our fall
