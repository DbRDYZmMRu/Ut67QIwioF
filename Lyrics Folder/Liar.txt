[verse 1]

bail me

beam it on me

fighting my disorientation

wailing for a sum to mention

i feel the sad around here

i feel so demented

i feel like my life is not going nowhere

it’s just for a second i mourn

hear the thoughts i entertain

i feel like my life is not going nowhere

i feel the world has turned down . . .

it’s out for itself

i feel this ceiling is not going any higher


[verse 2]

does it ever make me feel gross

that i pick up the microphone and i go prr

does he ever make me feel bad

when i’m in my room

and i’m thinking about my heart’s hole

i think i did that too

talking about a girl that told me

she’s on the mark. i do

looking like i don’t ever have to

tell someone

i really care, her coo

[verse 3]

oh oh, help me now

don’t tell me, you forget now

i really love we’re quarrelling now

but this is a mound for sappy heart

oh, looking back

i think i never had

a time to cover your harms

now i’m a common liar

when i walk around

but i know not to choose the hand

slight of my likes

i don’t take it back

when i say it’s got a hard rhyme

i’m not hi in town
