[chorus]

honey, so we’ll evolve

our love in a vibe

from above

touch me now

don’t you say we left it off

don’t say we’re not enough

don’t say it

don’t say it


[verse 1]

how can take i back words

that i don’t really mean

do i mean them now

though i really said it twice

oh, these words

they come like a clot

and i’m caught in the sore of our love

armistice, in the morning you promise

but i don’t feel in nothing

it’s scram miss

oh will you

i want you here

a living video record
