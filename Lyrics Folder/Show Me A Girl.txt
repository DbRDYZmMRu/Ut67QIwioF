[intro]

show me a girl

tell me her name is nothing to tell

show me a girl

tell me her name is nothing to tell


[verse 1]

that could be kendall

someday i will take paracetamol

arm myself, that’s a never tool

i’m not looking for no one

that’s another bell

i just need that girl

she knows she makes me overtime

she will roll up

share her roll up

and i’m real enough about a smoke up

it don’t mean that i’m a rebel to tail her

but annal looking at myself

i ‘on’t ever go up

i ‘on’t ever take time to freestyle

be myself, like i’m tryna get this girl

her name could be kendall jenner

i don’t know if she will pretend

that i’m unto her, wanna do her, i ran to her

and know who is coming for this

oh he’s coming forward on this

that i’m unto her, i’m unto her, i’m unto her

in autumn

fine, he’s over on this

she’s down to rim

[verse 2]

well she’s probably a race

and i’m delirious

with my thoughts and my imagination

somebody get a ring

i’ma about put a ring on her finger

i think i’m kinda lost on my screen

but i don’t spend enough time

i’m not really sure

i don’t get enough time out of this zone

i’m not myself that should be in the bone

that should be in the bone

i ‘on’t really go off

but i know that she makes my bum bum bum go

like rap papa

i’m not sure what put me on these days

it’s probably that or that or that, or her smile

probably could be the only reason

i’m always thinking of her buying

and if you get one

better be someone

who is gonna bring me like

kendall is everywhere arresting me

making me feel like i’m in a realer dream

i ‘on’t really know if it is, or he’d rather grin

but i know all i ever do is make hit

[outro]

hum d+mn chain

thinking on the shen

thinking of her dream

thinking of a time

when that dream will all be

. . . in the bill you know
