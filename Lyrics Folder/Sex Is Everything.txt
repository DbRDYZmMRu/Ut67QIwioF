[intro]

fresh boy chilling

s+x could be everything


[verse 1]

if it is everything then i’m going up

if it is everything i’m going up

s+x could be everything

s+x could be everything

s+x could be everything

s+x could be everything


[verse 2]

that makes your body everything

when touching it

i’m kissing it

i’m loving it

s+x could be everything

it could be everything

so convinced

s+x is everything

how you make it еverything

pulling on your hair

holding my hand

don’t you let go

s+x could bе everything

this could be everything

s+x is everything and more

[bridge]

what’s more

let’s do it again


[verse 3]

ticking my time

break a foot in her door

i could tick her time

just to take her bow

break it down

like i’m peddling

a guess on her ball

her key reel

like i’m drowning in her harp


[outro]

s+x is everything

s+x is everything

s+x is everything

s+x is everything

everything, everything
