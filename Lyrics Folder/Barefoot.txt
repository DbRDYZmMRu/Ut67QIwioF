[intro]

fresh boy chilling

it’s a smooth ride

with you by my side

and i’m dreaming more than half the time

if this will be forever


[chorus]

say it, place it, how it plays the song

say it, place it, for where our song starts


[verse 1]

the queue comes on

i hear our songs play through the strings strumming in my headphone

thinking of you got me feeling

barefoot headed to you

this fight, this night

it’s gone to ruminating

joy if the song comes on

and i don’t want it to be morning

for me in the know that this is

just me acting, be it funny

thinking that it ends in the dark

with my hands at the back

thinking of what i’ve done wrong

[chorus]

say it, place it, how it plays the song

say it, placе it, for where our song starts


[verse 2]

i take this oftеn as a joke

my feelings, they are acting so spirally

bet it comes with the role

acting so flawed with my little gaze on you

i’m bothered cos

i better count my numbers

i told myself when that mirror was backed to myself


[chorus]

say it, place it, how it plays the song

say it, place it, for where our song starts
