[verse 1]

i have spent a lot of time in darkness

but this time it’s feeling really different

like something out there is not true

and it is the right sense

of this bad tenses that i might choose

but i don’t know if am i a choos

and my rules on this cruises

that i keep going on

like i got shoes to walk in them

boos to hold them down

and i ain’t need a new good to hold me down

but i’m feeling darker in here

like the lights is not real

and it’s just fox in there

and i don’t know what to take time for

maybe it’s this

or maybe it’s being i’d visit more

because every time it is nothing but crease

i’m trying to look for a better plate

like a better view of my dress

but it’s nothing else

it’s just the mess

and i’m hoping that

i don’t get someone vexed

[verse 2]

tell me that it’s not the rest of it

tell me that it’s not what i hope i’m best at

making a f+cking address

of something that i should have not done in the first

i better get my only girl out there

before i get myself in another weekend of regrets

and i’m still hoping for the light

hoping that there is something

that i can really take my time to you know fight men

nothing but myself that is the rights men

and i know that it’s not only about myself

but i just, it is tough to say it is me on the mic

like what else, oh my god

and i’ve done nothing right

nothing on this beat right

isn’t even me

or dizzy this fight of this sh+tes

of this girl that i really want to say that

i’m lost in the darkness not the light

and even when i’m looking out there

it’s the darkness in my heart

that is really holding me down

and i’m wondering what is it i have done

what is it i have done

it is not so serious

maybe i should just get myself honour

[verse 3]

put myself in front of a raven and you know

cut it off with a scissors

say i bought her a house

say i bought her something better

like girl you don’t need that

we don’t need to be out

without a door and kneeling

we can put it somewhere

and say we washed them really clean

like no the dry cleaners had enough

so we had to take it somewhere

that babe and i could be like

sure we lit


[background music]

if i was letting you go

it would be forever

dancing like whatever

if i was letting you go

it would be forever

i’d be dancing like whatever

you should know

got a show

goes on

i’m in the attic pondering what now

girl you should know

my show goes on

in the attic pondering

whether i’m still an addict

looking a mess

picking up tracts

i feel that nothing i’ll feel should be undressed

taking my mind out

nothing comes out

it’s this big mouth trying to be a lout

and i’ve been the one

sleeping, so pained, sipping

and i just ponder

do i feel they get the real picture

making me feel bad

making me feel like i don’t feel

how do you feel about that

my heart it’s not here no more

not with me no more

not how i want to
