[chorus]

sometimes i’m thinking of all the doily when i’m lost

sometimes he came in; get it right, winnowing lone star

sometimes i’m thinking of you when i’m alone by the nightstand

sometimes i can’t get it right

but i am not lost

whoa

i’m not lost

i’ll be right there

girl i am not lost

but you suss with the sweet side

i’m not lost at this

[bridge]

it don’t air if you’re holding

(i’m holding, i’m holding)

love don’t la+di+dah

you’re not

(i’m not holding, i’m holding)


[chorus]

sometimes i’m thinking of all the doily when i’m lost

sometimes he came in; get it right, winnowing lone star

sometimes i’m thinking of you when i’m alone by the nightstand

sometimes i can’t get it right

but i am not lost

whoa

i’m not lost

i’ll be right there

girl i am not lost

but you suss with the sweet side


[verse 2]

pinning all my wins down

i’m locking all my wins down

i’m taking all the wins out

it’s no avoiding the down

i’m taking all my wins out

i’m pulling all my pain out

i’m leaving all my canes out

i’ll be me

i’m down with me

[outro]

sometimes i’m thinking of all the doily when i’m lost

(i’m not lost)

calling on your name girl

i’m not lost

get it right, winnowing lone star

hold on; you’re the my girl

i’m not lost

i’m not lost

can’t get it right
