[intro]

fresh boy chilling

you are something special

find it in my mind

when i’m on here

you’re heaven than ever

over that, i’ll bitch, i could

could wonder


[verse 1]

nothing changes

we could be two birds flying

alone

nothing changes

we could be lovers forever

tell me when he’ll never resent you

i vary here


[bridge]

tender heart is here with me

no matter how far from the way hе …

love keeps hold of this cold out here


[verse 2]

you makе me whole again

don’t pay mind to how it feels at times

you make me whole again

don’t pay mind to how it feels at times

[bridge 2]

love comes knocking on your door again

and it says, i’m here with frith

love comes knocking again

and it says don’t you wait

let me in lover


[verse 3]

when this goes away

don’t you keep the calendar out

cos we gotta meet for our tryst

when this flows like nothing can take it out

tell me that you’ll be yahoo


[bridge 3]

nothing changes

we could be two birds flying

nothing changes

we could be lovers forever


[outro]

love comes knocking again

and it says don’t you wait

let me in lover

when this goes away

don’t you keep the calendar out

cos we gotta meet for our tryst

when this flows like nothing can take it out

tell me that you’ll be yahoo

ooh

tell me that you’ll be yahoo
