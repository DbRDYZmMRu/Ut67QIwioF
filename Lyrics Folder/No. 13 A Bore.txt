[chorus]

i’ll hold my gun

traipse this lawn

for once this son

inebriate ‘tween tote


[bridge]

is it in (in and winning with love)

to lead with love? (ain’t never sure)

in healthy touch

is it enough?

[verse 1]

everything you did for my heart; a spod

no i thought two won’t let it kindle enough

feel so used and washed off

i’m back to you

tripping tripping like a chopper

i ain’t ever felt better

now i’m counting the beats

feeling like od

i’m like oh!

dang!

ding bong

oh my gawd!

back to you

back to you

feeling like this ain’t another you

no+oh

this is not another me (oh+oh+oh)

oh+oh

we don’t need to haggle

over you

nothing, nothing


[chorus]

i’ll hold my gun

traipse this lawn

for once this son

inebriate ‘tween totе

[verse 2]

something like that

hey! beetlе, beetle, beetle

chip, chipping lines

but i’m stuck in a nerve or nav

a name or a nerve

i ‘on’t really know

if i should write or jot it down

write or jot it down

ain’t that the same

i’ll just put it like

binge, binge

my name on her next ring ring

i hope she call me

but she never does

so i’m stuck at the booth

writing her songs like a drunk

oh!

it’s no bam!

still sipping that 818

but i lost the one

so i’m feeling like i might be a bore

(cries playfully)
