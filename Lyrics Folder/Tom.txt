yeah!


[verse 1]

uh!

back to the past time

how it feels i

can’t get it right

i ‘on’t know if i am dreaming

i got a beamer torch

but that’s not what’s missing

so i put my f+cking mind on the pushing

n+ggers trying to put me on the f+cking eleven

i clock out when it’s time

that’s seven

i’ll be in the place

i’ll be like . . .

tom! tom!

it’s what i’m f+cking thinking about

my empty sores are no longer even sharp

rack a cut

in a body of like who better?

oh+oh

i’m f+cking trading out here

tryna duck a girl . . . disturb my life

on a f+cking wire

but i’m not walking sober

too much in my f+cking cup to give a f+ck about:

what is love?

i like the vibе, but i like . . .
