[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[chorus]

headed for what i want

clambering up these rungs

hail me, i’m your runt

how you got me burnt

torch my life

share what you shun

i’m not letting it go

i’m bagging this home

bagging this home

bagging your heart home


[verse 1]

no matter how many they are

their broken heart

i’ll find every bit

take you right there

to their start

to the start

to the start

where it all begun


[chorus]

headed for what i want

clambering up these rungs

hail me, i’m your runt

how you got me burnt

torch my life

share what you shun

i’m not letting it go

i’m bagging this home

[outro]

feel it, dizzying

are they ever gonna see a man in reason

when her will the fortitude

i’ve been hurting

every time i tried
