[intro]

break my heart apart

break my heart apart

and put me back

put me back

put me back


[chorus]

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell

[verse 1]

beam me up shorty

your body is calling

i don’t want wanna go black

caught up in your love

my heart is on fire

don’t lеt our love die out

huh

sweet sixteen glowing skin

first kiss

heart promisеs

clarity in kerosene

i was just a melody

so, i got my hopes up

who could have thought

you were gonna break my heart


[bridge]

break my heart apart

break my heart apart

and put me back

put me back

put me back

break my heart apart

break my heart apart

and put me back

put me back

put me back

[chorus]

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell


[verse 2]

wait!

how did our love lose course

and my lover lost her way

you never told me you was running out of love

i thought our trust was enough

i thought our trust was a bond

now you wanna cut me off

cut me off

cut me off


[bridge]

break my heart apart

break my heart apart

and put me back

put me back

put me back

break my heart apart

break my heart apart

and put me back

put me back

put me back

[chorus]

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell

she’s so exceptional

something like sunday special

ain’t no question about her facial

ain’t no question she’s a medal

and she got my heart in a love cell
