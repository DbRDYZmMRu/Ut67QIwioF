[intro]

i just woke up

sounding like a pro prop

i just woke up

sounding like a old prop

i’m a kid with a cosh

so i’m a fascist

i ‘on’t take no f+cking call

i just take my own for we’re lovers


[verse 1]

paying, paying

i’m paying whatever your ounce

she never wanted a front star

she only wanted what i could serve

they never wanted it from the start

now i’m back in the north

and i can’t tell my weight on the rope

and i’m feeling tao

weigh every word i f+cking spat

cos i’m lucky, loco

lock her with the f+cking tricks

and i’m weak, but i ain’t the no weaker treat

but i got the wicker witch

i’ma just put it and

lеt the f+cking acorns fall out to the basket

evеrything i ever had

put it on the pantaloon

chilling on the helm

make me look like

i’m still reeling on the fodder

this sh+t that i had

when i was quick

ill quirky, creaking on the bee

yeah, i do it like that

uh+oh i should have said n+gga

(scoffing)

spit this boy

ow!

like, look at my face

i can tell what the time is

tis, tis, tis

all i know is

tis, tis, tis, tis, tis, tis

hey, you’re sleeping

[verse 2]

i stay with the gold pack

uh!

my bob in a good wag

good wag

good wag bro

i stay with the gold pack

roll with the good

you’re wack

you can feel the heat when we come around

i don’t smile queen

but i do it in the pound

i do it in the pound

i roll with the pack

they won’t make me feel the record

never scared in my head

i know it’s a lack

alright

she cut me round the f+cking back

and her steel gold

i ‘on’t even know then about you

all i know is i’ma f+cking do what i really do

tiller hit the place that i keep the kitty do

ooh, ooh howdy dear

do the f+cking . . . hail your d+ck

i’m just going, now i’m perk

i’m tryna be me

eh! your hey

i just laugh like

your clapping ass take the stance sh+t

kobe on this f+cking helm mo coup
