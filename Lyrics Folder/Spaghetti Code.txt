[verse 1]

i’ve been taking it slow

you should know

love can be so

no invent goal

that’s how we’ll grow

take the back road

tell them you came through the front

but not the road

straight to my soul

how you got that love, get+go

working my love, letting go


[verse 2]

and i never could

play the role

but everything changes

dad k!lls you

how you make it easy

i can’t feed it on my ed

beating devil over h+lls

my kiddy coat

how you see, he saw

and this love goes, never come back

this love goes, it never comes back

[verse 3]

we could just havе it here

make it feel likе the air has changed

have me meek, have me feeling paired

to you, not just how you see it

something better

not just how you can receive it

something i can touch

how you make me feel

something i can swallow

likened to make me feel this good


[outro]

turn lead out

make you feel out of the whole world

turn lead out

make you feel out of the whole world
