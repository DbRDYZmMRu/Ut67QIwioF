[intro]

hey!

it’s your boy


[verse 1]

oh

why you go and gotta break my heart

oh

why i gotta feel so low

all i ever wanted was love

all i ever wanted was your touch

time so broken

off this loneliness

i’ve been down this road before

but i never thought i’d ever feel this way

no oh+oh

i don’t wanna go forward

like no oh+oh

i don’t wanna feel this way

girl you got my heart broken to pieces

now you say you want me back

i can’t even stand your countenance

girl i’m gonna be gone

before you call me up, i’ll be gone

i’m not even looking at you no more

i feel like you got a gun pointing to my hеart

i’m so, d+mned for this love i had for you

cursed, cos i callеd your name in the middle of the night
