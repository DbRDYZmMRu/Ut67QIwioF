[verse 1]

sometimes i wish i was a reusable bag

so my bidding back

i don’t want to be that little man

who never stands


[bridge]

burr on who i am

who i used to be

how long ‘fore i get the whisk

hit the mental bin

right we can all see

the turret clock cl!ck

hail your fl!ck

[chorus]

knocking off insouciant

all i ever want is you

all i ever don’t get is you

knocking off insouciant

all i ever want is you

all i ever don’t get is you


[verse 2]

d+mn i’m back

to her park

it’s not right

if it don’t hit the spot

you should let me know

why the gourmet revolves the core rim

marinate you all day

soots don’t heal your love


[bridge]

burr on who i am

who i used to bе

how long ‘fore i get the whisk

hit thе mental bin

right we can all see

the turret clock cl!ck

hail your fl!ck

[chorus]

knocking off insouciant

all i ever want is you

all i ever don’t get is you

knocking off insouciant

all i ever want is you

all i ever don’t get is you


[outro]

sometimes i wish i was a reusable bag

so my bidding back

i don’t want to be that little man

who never stands
