[intro]

capisce? let me reiterate

i do this sh+t, it’s just a habit

fresh boy chilling

in a mere, i don’t wanna be k!lling n+ggers out there


[verse 1]

mic, mpc, help me see what’s better

between these vices i got in my head

i think i’m acting like a winning leg, seen her egg

ever got in a safest

doing messages, something like the best sage is

cos i’ve never had a gulf, i tow myself

till i caught her lag, and i took the bag in the f+g

yeah, that’s the f+ggots out there

telling me that i’m still sh+tting my pants


[chorus]

cos i love her

better be ready

i’m coming with this sh+t hot

cos i love her

better be ready

i’m coming, this sh+t out the booth really red

cos i love her

better be ready

i’m coming with this sh+t hotter than you ever thought

cos i love her

better get ready

it’s never been this hot from the best

[verse 2]

who is to f+cking rag us

i’m chilling, i’m just, kinda currish

okay, we can never take this out there

okay, my name is on this

weakened knees, honest

i go with the girl and i tell her to undress

she’s got a fat ass

and now i’m looking like her dark baggage

yeah

let her know she can listen to my songs all weekend

let it take her through the weak days

cos weep goals are never tee pose

and my name is always on

sheep hoes are alright here?

looking like you got that oomph utz

everybody thinks his grunts

while i’m out here

i ain’t with these recruits
