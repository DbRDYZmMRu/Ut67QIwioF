[intro]

it is no murk

i see you clearly sofia


[bridge]

sofia, at the ready

i just need your number

it’s really trifle

who you send it through

word out

you got me catatonic

(blimey!)

it is crumbling

to my brute prurient

(bottoms up)

to all of my hub

pinterest pinups

[chorus]

and i’ll sing for it

cry my tears for it

i’ll tell a preacher

thanks for it

i’ll sing for it

(sing for it)

i’ll sing for it

(sing for it)

sing for it

all night long

(all night long)


[verse 1]

come on

you should put me out

hear me out

doubt clothe getting those digits

flaming the pain

i’m singing my name

my name

through your window pane

hear me out

you’ll be better wild

i just need your digits

(digits)

sofia (oh) sofia (sofia)

pour . . . d+mn!

those thoughts on me

[bridge]

sofia, at the ready

i just need your number

(number)

it’s really trifle

who you send it through

(i don’t carе)

word out

you got me catatonic

(oh! blimey!)

it is crumbling

to my brute pruriеnt

(bottoms up)

to all of my hub

pinterest pinups


[chorus]

and i’ll sing for it

cry my tears for it

i’ll tell a preacher

thanks for it

i’ll sing for it

(sing for it)

i’ll sing for it

(sing for it)

sing for it

all night long

(all night long)

[outro]

come on

you should put me out

hear me out
