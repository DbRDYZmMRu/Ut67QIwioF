[verse 1]

she’s the kinda girl who wants you

don’t want you loving her back

so i ignite my world

bite my bullet

brand your stereo jack

she’s so fomo

never leaving her alone

on my kneels

like oh my doll

[chorus]

i can’t let you go

feels like i’m on some bad trip

i just took some acid

why is our love so plastic?

my brain just hit automatic


[verse 2]

oh my my

i wish you could be mine

done this already

beat up

‘fore the bag

why . . . what to meet up for this pall

nerve! nerve! nerve!

is it all right if i let you go

be the bad liar bonding over a petty pool

pour my coke

lip service for a penny connection

nirvana won the election


[bridge]

why i know you run this way

gild the page

for me it’s all the same

why i know you run this way

gild the page

for me it’s all the same

[chorus]

i can’t let you go

feels like i’m on some bad trip

i just took some acid

why is our love so plastic?

my brain just hit automatic


[verse 3]

she trifle

she beat it up anyway

she doubt it

her pittance out my way

but i meant it

can’t get her out my brain

i just want her down the drain

where it is all inane

eenie meenie miney mo

i took her first

bloat up worse

bother . . .

can’t truce to a phrase

it’s all the same thing

beanie on a ghost

i took her first

bloat up worse

bother

can’t truce to a phrase

it’s all the same thing

[bridge]

why i know you run this way

gild the page

for me it’s all the same

why i know you run this way

gild the page

for me it’s all the same


[chorus]

i can’t let you go

feels like i’m on some bad trip

i just took some acid

why is our love so plastic?

my brain just hit automatic


[outro]

fond of the scene

never got enough

clutched on your evil

come and pick me up

now i’m popped on the thrill

a crop of your bill

yeah i’m popped on the thrill
