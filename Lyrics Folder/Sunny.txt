[chorus]

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startled

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startled


[verse 1]

and my love is not gone

you’re here with me

a mad court

a wrangle knot

you stay twiddling

[bridge]

shrilling

this hose it counting on

cleaning

this prose it at its dawn

running

burning

yeah, it is sunny


[chorus]

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startled

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startlеd


[verse 2]

popping?

on it

you should really know it

popping?

on it

you should really know it

[bridge]

shrilling

this hose it counting on

clеaning

this prose it at its dawn

running

burning

yeah, it is sunny


[chorus]

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startled

running on the lawn for the money

i’m playing possum till it’s sunny

headed for a veer, friends funny

dread it? i’m startled
