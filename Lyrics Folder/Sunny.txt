[chorus]

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startled

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startled

[verse 1]

And my love is not gone

You’re here with me

A mad court

A wrangle knot

You stay twiddling

[bridge]

Shrilling

This hose it counting on

Cleaning

This prose it at its dawn

Running

Burning

Yeah, it is sunny

[chorus]

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startled

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startlеd

[verse 2]

Popping?

On it

You should really know it

Popping?

On it

You should really know it

[bridge]

Shrilling

This hose it counting on

Clеaning

This prose it at its dawn

Running

Burning

Yeah, it is sunny

[chorus]

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startled

Running on the lawn for the money

I’m playing possum till it’s sunny

Headed for a veer, friends funny

Dread it? i’m startled
