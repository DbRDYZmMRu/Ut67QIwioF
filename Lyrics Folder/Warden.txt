[verse 1]

all my life i thought i had it

i thought i had it figured out

all my life i thought i had it

but now i think i gotta figure with . . .

my man say: you got till the end of the month

soon i’m erasing all this sh+t

like i . . .

i’ve got faces

i’m just tryna count the frames

oh my lord

i’m screening on this b+tch

ain’t n0body telling me how to move my cellular closer than i ever

got that girl like

oh!

talking like you ever had this cell

now i’m putting him where he, the f+cking n+ggers belong

don’t count the f+cking house

i’m switching up on all my regular reasons

i’m tryna find out why i never f+cking pity

i’m so pinned on my sheet

i might just take my tache

tell chantеl

she got me on another lovе

all my reasons got me feeling so sober

and i’m still feeling older

and i’m still feeling bothered

he’s never had a rudder

all we ever had was a oar

so we moving

so we moving

now we moving on

ain’t n0body steering at my f+cking stern

ain’t n0body balling my f+cking bowl

so i told them i’ma be d+mn bold

you ain’t never gonna man me up

feeling like you ever had the f+cking rowdy up

i’m always f+cking all the rimae

with my f+cking, okay i c+ck

ca+(u)cu(s) circle

act like her?

she wasn’t even caught

put my freak on you

you like talk spam

we so close

feeling cute . . . you were co+umpteen?

laevu(lose) aura

ah!

at this!

she didn’t mail my sh+t

and i bought her

(into her distractions)

drugs are my sh+t

and i want out

i’m not even in for your sober

[outro]

as i say like a f+cking outro

chilling with my voice like a f+cking cackle

you can come around if you’re f+cking

in the f+cking handle

i’m still acting like i got no f+cking handle

but you can find me on valenceeve if you got a bundle

oh boy!

i’m feeling fondue

rondeau is a poem i wrote like hands do

you ain’t never gonna find me outside

my girl see betty get ready

i’ma f+cking hit you with a cl!ck
