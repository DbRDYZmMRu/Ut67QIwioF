[intro]

oh, tell me now

she’s here

tell me now

i can’t be here

don’t be sarah

don’t be so far from me


[verse 1]

i’m painting you all the time

(like all my lines)

when my dial my numbers

oh i?

think that it ends on you

cos i want what is mine to be yours

sometimes i’m waiting here in h+ll

sometimes it’s not really whole ham

two face, a roaming in noun

all i know is i am stuck

just you

us two, hit the pier

you’re boo

i’m feeling i won her soul in pound

can we take a moment to slow down

can we take a moment to slow down

(take a moment)

[verse 2]

cos all these emotions

make it pour down from without

take my hands fastened to the world

pour my love on you

doesn’t have to be more than this

flux, caressing in domes

clocks, hutch you are mine

my blindfold sees you

i’m not out for the war with girls

they’d be minding their own ass

a very consuming run

hold me down

(hold me down)
