[intro]

Theo, theo

I ‘on’t know if this is on the link

But i’m chained daunt

[verse 1]

Hubbub, dud dud, dotted, hovered

Sorted

Ordered, corded, brothered, lauded

Forever

[bridge]

Accrue heave it all away

A trot to

Hit trip

From the train

Uh oh

Trestle for the sad sod

Fret through how the ardour

Yeah!

[chorus]

I’ll ride for you on shadowless night

Pray thine . . .

A colourful light

Oh oh

Colourful light

Colourful light

I’ll ride for you on shadowless night

Pray thine a colourful light

[verse 2]

I’ll never get enough

Patch over my love

Saddle wrath on my heart

Sodden, sodden

Soddеn in grateful love

Sodden, soddеn

Sodden in grateful love

[outro]

I’ll ride for you on shadowless night

Pray thine . . .

Colourful light

Colourful light

Oh oh

For your colourful light

I’ll ride for you on shadowless night

Pray thine . . .

A colourful light
