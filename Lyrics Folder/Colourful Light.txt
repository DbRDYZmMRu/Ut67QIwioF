theo, theo

i ‘on’t know if this is on the link

but i’m chained daunt

hubbub, dud dud, dotted, hovered

sorted

ordered, corded, brothered, lauded

forever

[bridge]

accrue heave it all away

a trot to

hit trip

from the train

uh oh

trestle for the sad sod

fret through how the ardour

yeah!


[chorus]

i’ll ride for you on shadowless night

pray thine . . .

a colourful light

oh oh

colourful light

i’ll ride for you on shadowless night

pray thine a colourful light


[verse 2]

i’ll never get enough

patch over my love

saddle wrath on my heart

sodden, sodden

soddеn in grateful love

sodden, soddеn

sodden in grateful love

i’ll ride for you on shadowless night

pray thine . . .

colourful light

oh oh

for your colourful light

i’ll ride for you on shadowless night

pray thine . . .

a colourful light
