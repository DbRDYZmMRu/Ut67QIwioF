i just got a new text

recess

meet up no pretence

pass it on

cos, i got these girls on me

she kissing through the phone

cos she solely on me now

text text

i just got a new text

recess

meet up no pretence

pass it on

cos, i got these girls on me

she kissing through the phone

cos she solely on me now

[verse 1]

i don’t wear

always on some new threads

looking like a rip+off

yeah, you know i own this turf

dancing like an alligator

feed her up her imagination

shake her up; her vibrator

vroom vroom

on the dome

looking like i rule the world

i don’t call the plug

that’s a tag, that’s a cog

where the pot?

line the dots

picturesque

line the shots

turned over over

woke up bobber sober

toppled over dreaming hallelujah

(hallelujah)


[bridge]

i’m too fresh for my own good

don’t hit a girl it’s for her own good

lemon on p+ssy that’s a crude cruise

drooling on me that’s a bib loose

swearing over sh+t

cos you never rode a mercedes

i’m too fresh for my own good

don’t hit a girl it’s for her own good

lime on p+ssy that’s a crude cruise

drooling on me that’s a bib loose

sweating over sh+t

cos you never rode a mercedes

[verse 2]

m+i+d+d+l+e to my last hoe

bellow him hope he a frodo

hollow thoughts like a doughnut

undeveloped like a tadpole

pejorative like a bag of salt

i on’t even sight the cork

i just swipe the racket

swipe the racket

pimped her up

she was a ratchet

sleeping she was eating up perishable

panic on red she was susceptible

shopping on me girl no decimal

right next to you

that sh+t

this sh+t is ours it is perennial

[bridge]

i’m too fresh for my own good

don’t hit a girl it’s for her own good

lemon on p+ssy that’s a crude cruise

drooling on me that’s a bib loose

lime on p+ssy that’s a crude cruise

drooling on me that’s a bib loose

sweating over sh+t
