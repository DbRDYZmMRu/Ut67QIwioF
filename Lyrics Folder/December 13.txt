[chorus]

buffing over issues doesn’t count

when you’re not around a lot of burden

solving all my issues doesn’t wane

when you let the cat out

yeah

i can’t get it right girl

it begs some pun done undone

and now when the bad back

yeah i am back, back to the start

[verse 1]

is it all right?

if i let it go

make the feeling sit all right

send it from the stop

yeah we feeling it non stop

and now i am part of the soul

is it another dame?

i thought the part

i tore it apart

i’m still with the wraith you h++rd out

still by the radio holding your heart

is it enough?

is it enough?

weighing my heart on a ledger page

i need to know

what become of me


[chorus]

buffing over issues doesn’t count

when you’re not around a lot of burden

solving all my issues doesn’t wane

when you let the cat out

i can’t get it right girl

it begs some pun done undone

and now when the bad back

yeah i am back, back to the start

[verse 2]

eh! eh! you stun!

mooring on the lather, eh!

uh

they get it on

you log it

bring it on on

your loving

ain’t no loving when you’re loving

and you’re loving

you loving all heart

pall on the lonesome

better than i can sulk about it

i’m stuck in the sob party


[chorus]

buffing over issues doesn’t count

when you’re not around a lot of burden

solving all my issues doesn’t wane

when you let the cat out

i can’t get it right girl

it begs some pun done undone

and now when the bad back

yeah i am back, back to the start


[outro]

i can’t get it right now

when you let the weight down now
