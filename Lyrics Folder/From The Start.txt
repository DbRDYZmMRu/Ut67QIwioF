[intro]

am ’bout to get it right now

got the reelers out

this ain’t no comeback

got the realest out

winning jones


[verse 1]

soothing prose

had some of those

how it feels when you’re hitting notes

from scruffy toes

tussle toss tuck my pickle hope

i could grow up

but my caddy hollow

under umbrella with an ordinal

on this

beat it! (beat it!)

heard a call from the galley

penchant sh+t

so i hit it

in the dining

another eeny

on my hammock i’ll be reeling

nitty+gritty

swish a titbit

precocious i’ve been handed the garter

hustled for a take now it all feels like banter

banter

[chorus]

am ’bout to get it right now

got the reelers out

this ain’t no comeback

got the realest out

winning jones

am ’bout to get it right now

got the reelers out

this ain’t no comeback

got the realest out

winning jones

jones


[verse 2]

she had a ballast had me in rough waters

on the zinc had me no drama

joie de vivre

she’s the girl who make you burn the vista

and they say i don’t drink no alcohol? (alcohol)

but i still put the sh+t to work

put in work

in the zinc had to hit her luck

no fumble mop (here’s the truth)

come hurdle form

another prom

adult topping for a one way cone

[chorus]

am ’bout to get it right now

got the reelers out

this ain’t no comeback

got the realest out

am ’bout to get it right now

got the reelers out

this ain’t no comeback

got the realest out


[outro]

soothing prose

had some of those

hitting notes

couple those

soothing prose

had some of those

hidden gnomes

water those

oh+oh

i see

my sea

saw my i ams
