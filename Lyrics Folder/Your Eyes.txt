[intro]

your eyes

your eyes


[chorus]

i can’t look into your eyes

when we all alone

i can’t breathe

i can’t look into your eyes

when we all alone

i can’t breathe

gag me

gag me

till my heart f+cking drops

gag me

gag me

how come my words never hold water

when i let them out

had my heart arid

up my windpipe

is a draught

put it in a song

mislead for a scythe

still, it’s in your eyes

[verse 1]

love your proclivity

your skin my vice city

be my cain

i’ll keep your name

that’s a pact

we nocturnal birds

how we comе alive

you’re a dint in my universе

something like an epiphany

am on my knees for it

would walk on tulips for it

would you pick pips for it?

your love strewing through my veins

propane i’m haloing high up

are we there yet?

is that a movie what’s that

i’m stuck in your eyes that’s a handcuff

acting like this ain’t going nowhere

it’s a bankrupt

i can’t see

i can’t come alive without you


[chorus]

i can’t look into your eyes

when we all alone

i can’t breathe

i can’t look into your eyes

when we all alone

i can’t breathe

gag me

gag me

till my heart f+cking drops

gag me

gag me

how come my words never hold water

when i let them out

had my heart arid

up my windpipe

is a draught

put it in a song

mislead for a scythe

still, it’s in your eyes

[outro]

it’s in your eyes

it’s in your eyes

still, it’s in your eyes

oh, oh, oh
