[intro]

i am


[verse 1]

sometimes i feel our assets been the same

sometimes i feel i’m by myself

and i met you

match you

hope

it was the end of it all

it’s the end of it; dome

chip

dongle, i got no dongle

ah!

putting on the lot; on the line now

par

i’m putting all my lot on the line now

park

going back

my kinda like back

like an hack

danky hack

switching up on the map

mark, chorography

offering off a lark

tripping, suddenly

i’m back at you

whoa

never could find it that hard

[verse 2]

tripping off a line

hidden, anywhere it goes back

dreaming of a dart

never could find another hack

so i put in her mail

put it in the main

it says, it is where we at

yo i put it on the main

says, it is where i’m at

fine, it is you

cold therapy with my girl

this ends the veil

her p is in the care

her love; it’s in the veil like a bent thot

the light’s up

so that means i’m now another dada?

ah!

pervert, you’re in

brethren

i like it
