[chorus]

someone asked me

do i think my love doesn’t got it

someone asked me

do i think that my heart still got it

i told them i try

i dot my is

i told them

valentine won’t be the end of her cries

my life on the line


[verse 1]

be my bride

the question that doesn’t get a decline

how did i become one to win at saying his

i went from being on down, down, zero

to winning at this fight

you know i’m taking no whys

just f+cking pines

f+cking pines


[verse 2]

that is now way too gone

and i just want the past

i want the past

i want the past

want the past

[outro]
