[chorus]

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

feeling like a race ship

when i’m next to you

tweaking like a courtier

when we against the world

soak up my soul

we pr+ne to be dangerous

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

[verse 1]

it’s bout that hour

money power

drown in powder

college drop out

marian lover

she heard my song

she want no other

call me arthur

i wield that magic

call the author

i need that plastic

serenity of fashion

it’s my real circle

brain of banter

she love a swagger

pariah brighter

you should have heard they raucous

it’s a throng when i party cram a single cell

hotshot for a zen in a hotchpotch

flush hot she curse shots or what

lights down with the derelict partying

you and i subtle a w+nk off

carry out what’s your home choice?

in character i’m way sinister

bedizen your ass should be enticing

got me feeling like am bout to get with toni braxton

this ain’t no carousel

straight to the winceyette

[chorus]

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

live fast

live fast

i ’on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

feeling like a race ship

when i’m next to you

tweaking like a courtier

when we against the world

soak up my soul

we pr+ne to be dangerous

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

[verse 2]

stuck in a bog of bucks

can’t air it out

paraphernalia i’m about that life

neon lights i come alive

more fans than banister up the twin tower

hit that pert once now she says i’m a chooser

insecurities, frivolities reason why i’m secured on all these

i ‘on’t second guess it

gas up the rails

i don’t pr+ck or regress it

like clasped hands praying on pew

yahoo! yahoo! now my life a weisure


[chorus]

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride

feeling like a race ship

when i’m next to you

tweaking like a courtier

when we against the world

soak up my soul

we pr+ne to be dangerous

live fast

live fast

i ‘on’t ever reverse

fending off the old life

stuck on a rail

i ain’t coming off this ride
