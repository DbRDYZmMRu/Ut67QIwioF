[chorus]

me in the morning

i feel real sad

me in the afternoon

i feel real bad

haven’t spoken to you

soaked in probables

missing it

when i’m not close to you


[chorus]

me in the morning

i feel real sad

me in the afternoon

i feel real bad

haven’t spoken to you

soaked in probables

missing it

when i’m not close to you

[verse 1]

haven’t spoken to you in a moment

i feel like i should call and explain things

i cannot h++rd this

my heart’s sprout still professing

you’re still the one for me

can’t deny i’m on top of this

needing you, hinged in

latching on is this it?


[bridge]

ache pain in my bloodstreams when you’re away

my love is always a call away

bottled letters just a shore to sway

pending on a touch so far away

i’ma let it slide

dream for another day

strumming at this harp up in arms


[chorus]

me in the morning

i feel real sad

(real sad)

me in the afternoon

i feel real bad

(feeling bad)

haven’t spoken to you

soaked in probables

missing it

when i’m not close to you

[verse 2]

i pull up where you left me

tangent of bye and it sets in

docile mind and i’m stirred in

hurling on your warmth like a peck in

please stay true to this

are your stiles still on

touch up for miles

i’m still yours


[bridge]

ache pain in my bloodstreams when you’re away

my love is always a call away

bottled letters just a shore to sway

pending on a touch so far away

i’ma let it slide

dream for another day

strumming at this harp up in arms


[chorus]

me in the morning

i feel real sad

(real sad)

me in the afternoon

i feel real bad

(feeling bad)

haven’t spoken to you

soaked in probables

missing it

when i’m not close to you

[chorus]

me in the morning

i feel real sad

(real sad)

me in the afternoon

i feel real bad

(feeling bad)

haven’t spoken to you

soaked in probables

missing it

when you’re not close to me


[outro]

i just want you here

taking my words backs

picture your response crying

my loss a knee raring

oh i just need all these nix to rain numb

blur it say you’re hero
