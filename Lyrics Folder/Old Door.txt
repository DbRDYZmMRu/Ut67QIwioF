[verse 1]

it’s coffee in my hands

and it’s got me feeling so good

maybe it is this mood

have me feeling this foolish

something like love

would i ever say

it’s how i want to put it down

write it down saying roulette


[chorus]

but girl i say though

my real cuffs down our old door

matching i call out every time

i call out every time

but girl i say though

my real cuffs down our old door

matching i call out every time

i call out every time


[verse 2]

spirits flowing through me

dancing through me

feeling like it is so alien

holding mine

beat+beat+beat+beat beat it

ah

i get no+no+no nothing

i’m feeling, feeling really dizzy

when you’re here

when you’re here

how you hit+hit+hit me

girl i see it how i see it

i don’t see clear clearly

[chorus]

but girl i say though

my real cuffs down our old door

matching i call out every time

i call out every time

but girl i say though

my real cuffs down our old door

matching i call out every time

i call out every time
