[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

playing these games

though we call it kings games

playing this same dames

over and over on the radio

and i know who has got this

and i know who is going to get this

when i say he got the mark

i’m never on num band

oh give it up

i get eviscerated

i never say

i’m being lance sake; stays


[chorus]

when i get a girl, i just see your face

when you told me

that you gonna always be my saviour

i get the ghetto

i get the foetus

i get the always lean on my

hey, you will grow up

[verse 2]

i’m bust on this

when i hit the scene like i’m lost on this

when i take my time i get enough of this

how do i lead myself with this

when i’m stuck in the same place i started

with nothing to put on the pavement

and i know that i got a placement

will it be the same?

that’s a nutter

because this is not adjacent

i’m lost on nay faces

hilt, like i gotta do it

demise on many men

i’m knowing when i’m calling

i’m saving one year of howling

like he’s seating out of buckingham

and i’m hauling in, sending enough frigates

and i get, i in ghetto

you’re not that supposed with it

crutch with it, like he’s never haunted

i’m just an artist tryna get the claw at this

hoping, i never forfeit

what’s important than a foe

what i know i gotta say on this

trying to save myself

never savour myself

wish you, wish you, that is me

cos, i’ve been where you’ve been like

you’ve been with that bin at

it is there for reeling

we’re tryna get it, all the districts

like we’re tryna do it for the

frisson with the acne faces

i keep plundering your kales

like it’s just shallots

yeah
