[intro]

right? it’s like ah!

we’ll see

oh, we’re on this floor here

okay

so camel down

it’s all hunky+dory

no jack, hugged

bottoms up

(laughter)


[chorus]

yeehaw oh+oh

awe at door

yeehaw oh+oh

oh frail

yeehaw oh+oh

oh


[pre+chorus]

facts add up

numbers don’t count

hitting the wrong

mind dinged up

left my soul flunged in the brushed

caught ditch chore

chopped pitch sure

slurred to a stall

shut this one

fraught i hold a prop

poor, i had the rump

purport to hang on a plot

never had a thought

watch you call a shot

if i had mood past my songs

on the journal they go

ever leaning on the cull

hold this trot

[verse 1]

perfect, direct

when you came

oh he was the young

the volley live on

let my ball free

pouf, i was in your box

stood, with a troop that much

bloop, my time with taylor

privatе chilling losing that, it is our fondling

holly, you’re up

a lonely man, with no mind away

oh mam, mind her way


[chorus]

yeehaw oh+oh

awе at door

yeehaw oh+oh

oh frail

yeehaw oh+oh

oh


[outro]

facts add up

numbers don’t count

hitting the wrong

mind dinged up

left my soul flunged in the brushed

caught ditch chore

chopped pitch sure

slurred to a stall

shut this one

fraught i hold a prop

poor, i had the rump

purport to hang on a plot

never had a thought

watch you call a shot

if i had mood past my songs

on the journal they go

ever leaning on the cull

hold this trot
