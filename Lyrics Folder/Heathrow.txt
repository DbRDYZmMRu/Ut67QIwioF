[intro]

Yeah

[chorus]

My alter ego is like hopping off to heathrow

I got some field notes

So i’m hoping for some deep throats

You can hit me up

But don’t talk about jet lag

You can hold me

But don’t care about this charm

[verse 1]

My natural mama hates it

When my tongue is out

And my real mama thinks that

I could care about

Better things like

How my life is

Talking about it

Talk about it

How my life is

Talk about it

Took a body

Took a bad day

[bridge]

Are you subscribed

Sure how you do

[chorus ii]

My alter ego is like hopping off to heathrow

I got some field notes

So i’m hoping for some deep throats

You can hit me up

But just don’t yap about jet lag

You can hold me

But don’t torch

Don’t care about this charm

[verse 2]

My natural mama hates it

When my tongue is out

And my real mama thinks that

I could carе about

Mums

[chorus]

My alter ego is like hopping off to hеathrow

I got some field notes

So i’m hoping for some deep throats

You can hit me up

But don’t talk about jet lag

You can hold me

But don’t care about this charm
