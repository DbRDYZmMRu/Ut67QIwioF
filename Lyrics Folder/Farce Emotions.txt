[intro]

hey

fresh boy chilling

i don’t bother

her on border

i don’t bother

and she knows i’m about her here

feelings so farce

i don’t bother

when she’s on my mind

i’m on border

loving how i do

when i don’t bother


[verse 1]

drugs in my head

on my mind

how she got me feeling when i’m feeling so high

drugs in my head

on my mind

how she got me feeling when i’m feeling so fly


[verse 2]

i’m down to earth when i hurt with her

looking like i could text her

though if i wanna

how she friendly got me feeling like another

i’m better than them frith

how that will get you harder

she works it

got mе fake a god, any key dear you own

[verse 3]

prеtty girl loving the sizzle

pretty girl loving the stations up

pretty girl loving the seizures up

pretty girl loving decisions up


[verse 4]

lip to lip

dreaming

tip to tip, faint here

love how we got we the whole world lead electric

switching on the forward risk

looking like in gore of this

what they say don’t bother

when you read enough
