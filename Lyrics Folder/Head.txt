[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

it’s nothing serious

it’s just me on my business

you know

nothing serious

it’s just spinning

it’s another day

better best believe

just another face

punch to see it

i’m here on my vape

and you know what you know

when you know we ain’t no

and nothing makes me down from this

better know

bet on no

better known

nothing brings me down from your love


[chorus]

i will try

i will try

get it off my head

bet i’ll try

bet i’ll try

get it off my head

[verse 3]

saving nothing more

not leaving out anything

i’ll pay for her wrist, sending more

feeling i’ve got a tear vase

heartache

talk to me

she say i’m pained

got nothing left

a way you say

nothing left to say


[bridge]

and my head next to you will i grow

am i next to you till i grow

oh clacks to you

we are one then crow


[verse 4]

just say it

just say it how we . . .

you’ve said he ate

back to it

a map to her heart

better off if i find it

if i don’t

i might be lost where i don’t wanna

a spade right next to me

h+ll will allow me

coot down around my wells
