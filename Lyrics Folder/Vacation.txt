[intro]

come on, cos i don’t talk about patek and designers don’t mean i never bought some girl some. you know, trip it in, all that sh+t, it cost a lot.

but it don’t cost nothing to say sh+t about me except you’re putting on tmz. 


[verse 1]

yeah, i wanted to fly away

i just want to take a vacation

i just want to fly away

i just want to take a vacation

but i have got too much work over here

my girl is not down

she say the hustle is real

too real

it is the money coming in

it’s d+mn too real


[chorus]

so i’m staying in my own way

till i get a vacation

i am fapping my head out

till i get a donation

summer come

summer car

summer cum

(i get the laud)

she could be

but now it’s time passed our check

she could be, she could be

but now it’s time passed our check

(but not letting go)

[verse 2]

i feel at times that my attitude is not

on key

mama told me

please you know, you are somebody

so i guess i need a vacation

we should talk about our fornications

i don’t know if i’m on this; the right station

but i know that yes i need a vacation

i know i need a vacation

my girl told me the hustle is real

hold on boy, you need to hit this deal 


[outro]

hey, so if you’re talking, make sure you’re spending money on that, cos at the end of the day, no one’s listening like? who is listening? hey! who is listening right? i could be smoking weed and doing drugs on the beach from a girl like, sommer ray is not too far from here, she’ll probably be one of the first to listen to this track, and that’s a tender care, if you know what i mean, and if you are looking for a princess, yes, you’re not looking too far, because you are listening to a prince. so, in the end it’s all about life being a vacation
