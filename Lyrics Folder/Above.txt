i think i’m above it

i’m tryna find you

tryna survive

and now i found you

keep fighting

get it right

i tell myself

only i can’t really find myself

feels like

she want me starting loving mine

got stuck with you

cos you always in my rear view

and i’m racing

right back to you

feel you crossing through the stairs

i can’t find you

her seed above it

but i can’t till

come above it

i’m drowning in deep waters

so you find me in gills

i can’t get enough of this

julian

….

tell me if it is real

look in me

out my mind

the voices in my head don’t celebrate

and you’re always kinging me like i’m about to go insane

[the more sane than the sane voice]

but i know

i still feel the pain

when i pick up my phone

when i look at your photos

i really know those

you got mе

got me stuck in this place

like i still didn’t hit him back

i got nothing in my brain

you don’t think

that’s rеally jewel

it’s a fvcking brain rut

got me feeling like

i can’t keep this sh+t

on my own

you’re sure my misery

you got me really looking like a show
