[verse 1]

does it ever come down

you pay to need

the pain you need

is it heaven in that room then

does he ever come down

you pay to need

the pain you need

done with heaven now

does he ever come down

the bay you need

you’ve been near

here about asking the same questions

does he even know you are dinned

ever hail

does it ever

will you ever come down

you pay to need

the pain you need

pain in your ears

stay over

does it ever say enough then

is it over?

does it ever say, visiting

i’m salient, meddling

losing it on bed

all i ever had

was it? never enough in there (oh+oh)

then i had a pay

how i had her f+cking down

and i had a card

and i swiped her level right

does it ever come down

does it bid to me?

does it reign on me

do i ever feel pain (pain)

will i ever know

when he never

he has a car

will i ever know

will he ever have an end?

right now i am lost in my head

doesn’t it mean it is the end

when i hit the f+cking end

doesn’t mean it’s not the car

ah!

will i ever get it right?

how many questions

that will never make it to the rhyme

will i ever get a pen

so many questions that will never get . .

then leak a way

can i convince you

can hand you a chew

canary mark my tools

can i bet a dew

can a lever ever get a leak

that i went for food

if it was for real

wish she ever knew

it is nothing new

nothing new

my love for you

like a harpoon

it is nothing new

it is nothing new

this ready gun

if you’re repping
