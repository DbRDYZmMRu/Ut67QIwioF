[intro]

fresh boy chilling

we could fly to the party of the night


[verse 1]

i feel my time always frays away

when i’m with you, my lover

i feel that my overrate is not for revving

my number is still the same


[chorus]

but i always hear you

how you call my name

how you say

you held the same way too

i get off the ground

and i say

are you coming back to the store

cos i want something from here

back there, i hear it’s better at the start


[verse 2]

we’re out of spin

tell me about it

cos you’re never around

i’m always about it

when i hear you got a frown

and when i see you smilе

i want something from the store

is it somеthing beasty

i’m on my mane

oh, it’ll work

[chorus]

but i always hear you

how you call my name

how you say

you held the same way too

i get off the ground

and i say

are you coming back to the store

cos i want something from here

back there, i hear it’s better at the start
