I’m putting in a lot of time

Man enough . . .

Scribbling with the gun

When she’s my only thought

And she knows i got a lot of thought

My love’s on a purse

My pulse’s on a reject

My cost don’t aid my digestion

[curious chuckle]

[verse 3]

I just took another step from my cup

I’m feeling like i might never get enough

My kettle’s never gonna boil so . . .

Just have to wait for the rest of the night

So i’ll just

Scribble with a gun

I’ll just scribble with a gun

Till i’m like uncle phil. duh!

And i know that won’t matter, oh oh

Just cry if i am too petulant for my script

[outro]

Yeah!

I am scribbling with the gun

Scribble with the gun

How you like it when i’m scribbling with the gun

[laughs]
