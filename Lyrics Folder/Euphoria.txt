[chorus]

if i could turn the hands

i’ll turn it right to you

to the time when i thought it was just us two

something is missing

b+tton unfastened

i feel like i got the anti wound

if i could turn the hands

i’ll turn it right to you

to the time when i thought it was just us two

something is missing

b+tton unfastened

i feel like i got the anti wound

[verse1]

you were the type of girl to always get her panties off

i’ma let the d slide

yeah you always loved the rush

aren’t we made for this touch?

cuddle me insoluble love

fairy plunking on eros’ sling

subtle sock

imposed sinfonietta

shorty burned

yeah she loves her haughty alter

potter i mould her up party hunter

when we roll it’s a birthday shower

ash and pills

huff! huff!

melee rompers

coughs!

don’t you wait

duct tape is on your thoughts

it’s euphoria

make her o’clock

tick tick

tut tut

anti+wound

shove our problems under rug

primer on

see it out

living on a feeling

toothpick turn

heeding on to eden

it is sullen

holly earn

with my feathers on my back (my feathers on my back)

i can’t take a flight

i’m on wrench

holy veil

null me on

she saw me on

[voice note clip]

whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

jess i feel kind of um . . . distant

pff

oh gawd!

why, why, why

i woke up this morning

had a leak

well, i’m feeling it

went to the beach

i’ll call it a retreat

i’m back in the sheet

i’ll be okay

i woke up this morning

had a leak

felt it was lit

went to the beach

call the sh+t retreat

i’m back in the sheet

i’ll keep my distance

oh, i know i’ll be okay

i ‘on’t really know what the time is

but i’m just making this song

i wish we had cinnamon roll

but that don’t make me roll, roll

you make me roll

i think i’ma say that

when i know for sure

for sure

maybe i just did

aw!

i woke up this morning

had a leak

felt it was lit

went to the beach

call the sh+t retreat

i’m back on my bed right now

okay i really didn’t go to any beach

i just wanted to say um
