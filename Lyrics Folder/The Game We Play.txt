[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

and she should be what’s missing in my life

when i try to get this out of the way

i fail and i try again

not the first time this will come around and say


[bridge]

when will you be down

haven’t i showed you several times how to work it

(work it)

talk to me with the right words

maybe i’ll come around

come around


[chorus]

and its just the game we play

down for it

and she does her phantom of a move

its just the game we play

fanning dad’s candy all the time

ah, let it blow

it’s hot

let it blow out

ooh

let it blow out

how this sh+t sparkle all the time

[verse 2]

it could be that i’m in love

oh, i’m stuck in this holding forever


[bridge]

ah, let it blow

let it blow out

when will you be down

it’s hot

haven’t i showed you several times how to work it

let it blow out

talk to me with the right words

maybe i’ll come around

come around


[chorus]

and its just the game we play

down for it

and she does her phantom of a move

its just the game we play

fanning dad’s candy all the time
