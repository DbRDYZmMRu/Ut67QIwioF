[intro]

silver, ah ah

taylor, the stave you’re on

i don’t like myself being flood


[verse 1]

lancing through it all

my thoughts don’t hit it the way i want it

i can’t choose when i don’t feel important

maybe it’s the problem

it’s the problem

oh it is the thing

the one thing

i feel so flaky

saying this towards to you on a song

but i gotta let it out

gotta let it out

my heart weighing higher than a anvil

and my thoughts will not hold it down

d+mn, i feel so new

i feel so new to everything i am

[verse 2]

alright, if you say so dear

i never get it right

i lose myself when i say i love her

i’m right here

saying the words . . .

stuck

you’re about

i’m not who i feel


[outro]

it’s still the same

lost thе way i do

i’m lost on everything that makes mе up
