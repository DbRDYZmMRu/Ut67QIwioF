[intro]

how we started from the best

had me feeling it would last forever

what if my airbag

got the thought

this stick was the answer


[verse 1]

i don’t want her sake about it

i don’t wanna call your stream tomorrow

i don’t wanna say goodbye

i don’t wanna call you stray tomorrow

down, i’m back with my backpack

you’re not sober to it though

in the con, i am gone

one law, all day, i want this

ah!

one flaw

is it alright i want this

i want this sin on mile

out of clothes

oh, you’re erotic

feeling like these words

hold all of your answer

hold me, your answer

got me stuck

come and position your classes

i’m so caught up in all the passes

i’m not sure if i can buy this

i’m out here in a shelter

thenar the addict

[verse 2]

how we started from you lying on me

what’s the . . . your answer

how you tame my ken

got me feeling like who is diablo

(she’s only a guardian)

how you got me feeling like

now i’m about estranged up

no more nice hoe

halley your answer

you have me feeling like

let’s be your answer

sometimes i feel it

that’s it, your answer

call me, i hope you dial

if you don’t call

then you are over

sorry, if i think

you’re a broke ass sober

if you love me

then you will take a bag

i’m clambering what you’re unto


[verse 3]

i love it

i love it

i’ll call this tea

it is never in need girl

when i’m with you

it is unreal

it is never in need girl

when i’m with you

we sound euro

beautiful

if i had a levant

i know i am here the evil

made decisions

now i can’t get through the heliox

all these preachers

all these vigils

hold the lamp and touch your hair

i like the image

never tapping even though

we had a lunch toy

how you got it to me

leave the ceiling on

you know now this feeling

it is forever

how you had me from the start

had me feeling

who is he . . . the . . . your answer

how you tame my heart

had me feeling like this is the end

[outro]

i like to tame the heart

i want to work with some of that bane

i like you

so we can see if we love

you k!lled that shame, you
