[intro]

movie, our movie

oh+oh+oh+oh

please don’t say

shot, shot, shot

it’s the only

please don’t say

shot, shot

it’s the only one

it’s the only one

[verse 1]

not the girl

had my raunch child

one time

i’m not going for it

i lost my only time

i got my old fetters

over feeding

i can’t get off it

can’t get off it

so i had help

core with nip

you can call me anytime

you can call me

you can call me anytime

she’s my tennon

i’ll never give it right

i’ll never get it right

see i’m like kinda kind to her

devil will make me jump her

see i’m jazzing in my head

tryna get it right now


[bridge]

oh+oh+oh

can i hold on to my friend

oh+oh+oh

i’m tryna solve it in my head

you should not see me now

you should not dream that

you should not be this over your head

[verse 2]

i’m headed to the top

with my hands on the back of my purse

i’m her l+st

not going nowhere far

nowhere far

just ride here on this

over and over i try it again

over and over, am i mulling in the sea

i see eye sees

the more of there is

all i see, all i see, all i see

is more scheming bees

but i never get it right

never get it right

if i get stunned

never get it right

never get it right

through her case time

it’s a freestyle

it’s a “be” time

it’s the winning time

i just k!ll my figure, rhyme

time, give me some time

maybe you k!lled the vibe

k!ll the vibe and take a tie

and take my love

like it never could depart

i’m palavering

taking my shot like it is not weighing

oh+oh+oh+oh whoa
