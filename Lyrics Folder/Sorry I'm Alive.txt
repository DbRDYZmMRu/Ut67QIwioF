[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

despising what i can’t place a finger with a felling

hope it visits, my healing

cos i try, i cry

i ply my lane on chill

all the few gratings of me here

swathes the floor

and i wake to my demise

afraid i don’t weed out the best of me


[verse 2]

wishing on a few loves apart

i see my growing stride

faster i try

looking down on everything i can pray too

maybe it’s all i have

i try to be kind with myself

hoping for something better than this

not just this

hoping for something better than my curfew

and all the time i spend away

away with my problems

away with my hеart aches

away with nothing but

sorry i’m alive

wishing on a death

whilе i’m wishing on a debt of life

wishing on paradise

while i keep it inside
