[verse 1]

driving through the city with the lights up

palpitating soul, yeah my heart burns

all alone at the wrong time

preying my phone it’s a wrong dial

i can’t get enough

(get enough)

this feeling got me wanting some more

some more

(some more)

i can’t get enough

(get enough)

this feeling got me wanting some more

some more

some more

(some more)

at a cross road

criss+cross in my rear zone

mood swing this is post soul

(post soul)

crowd control mould fold

close to suppose to

stoked to posture

on my roll

don’t you dial my phone

when i’m all alone

this is morе than gold

(gold)

sinning is the motion

pleading don’t you mention

i’m nеver letting you near my soul

for a moment i thought you were the one for me

light it up

burn it down

you’re not the one for me

(money stops)

money never stops

(nothing)

ballin to the top

nut it at your level

name your spot
