[verse 1]

it’s no biggy now

we just kicked it off

from the start

with a text

and i told you

how i felt

and i h++rd your mind

the hall dating

now you should know

that love don’t have to

till my heart

it is already like a door

i told you my gun nozzle know

no it doesn’t

laced in love

her mound gold

the court about the yoga

merry+go move

my love for you girl

it’s nothing but a fawn

nothing but a fawn girl

it is nothing but a fawn

told you dear

a day if you are

i’ma take a fair run

to your roach . . . divan

i say nah

our love in this city

how hot

if you hear this

our love in the serene

i love what you’re saying

oh if they say

feels like you are the one

oh if they say he is the one

till you as a conе

if we realize that

wе two if we undo

we are a cone

was it to worry you
