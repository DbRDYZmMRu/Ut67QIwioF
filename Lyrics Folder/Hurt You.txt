[verse 1]

i never meant to hurt you

all i ever wanted was some closure

baby we need to come closer

ah!

i swear i never meant to hurt you

all i ever wanted was some closure

with some clothes on

cos it is cold out here

and i’ve been hurt so many times

ah!

got my heart numb like a f+cking glock

ah!

girl you got me looking at you from a side

ah! i’ma be fine

call me when there is no one there

i’ll be right there just to ease your pain

cos i’ve been hurting too

yeah, i’ve been hurting too

tell me why our love gotta so bad

maybe then i could put you on the map

tell me why our love gotta hurt so bad

baby i feel better when i pop these pills

oh lord, you gotta come now

cos i can’t take it no more

(ah)

i feel you and i was made for better
