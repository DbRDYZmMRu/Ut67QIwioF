[intro]

searching, unto something

all day

i’m searching for something

in my head

i’m searching for something

all day

i’m searching for something

in my head you’re a force

world day kissing

i can’t get it now

roil, they kissing

how can i get it now?

[verse 1]

i need to prepare the call from you

the one that says

no, we never move

be right here

ah!

i’m not missing it

can i pen it down

can i write it down

saying that i’m here with you

and it feels better than i ever could

no running

no running from your love

no running

no running from this hovering

dumb it down

we got a lamp, aladdin

pick it, backup in lab

oh i did

all my talk, enough in din

if i never had an evidence

you’ll say that we’re florescence

your love is supposed to be reverence

and still be sobering

you talk to me in ways

that i can figure out

you talk to me in ways

that i fill it out

you talk to me

and i feel it fl!ckering now

my love is not fizzling now

my love is not fizzling out

but you drench me

enough is healthy now

girl he is getting knocked

how can i?

get it back

put it back on a scale

saying that i’m there enough

saying that i’ve been better girl

ah, do i go back

down the lane

saying what doesn’t sound very sane

maybe to me, maybe not to you

or somebody listening

i don’t really know

you’re my anchor

something like a full author

i don’t know if this is roll our sail

but i know that everything is open

windows open

it’s all you

restore you

it’s all here

restored you

linking all my time

like he’s not gonna bore it in it

i can take my cinema

this is such a gel

girl, link it in

i’m just in my head

tryna f+ck her like a team, ah

in my shelf, i never see it ah

on a d+mn quale

that’s everything in it

i’m haunting; the silver rain

silver rain, cool knee here

corny, cannibal could have a chain ah

oh this is another pain

oh they say it

they say it

they say it
