[intro]

ah!

you gotta stack that emo sh+t

i love pretty girls


[chorus]

i’m not on my mobile

you can’t reach me now

but dance with me

dance with me

dance with me

i’m not on my mobile

you can’t reach me now

just bear with me

bear with me

bear with me

i feel like i’m on the f+cking appalachian

i get alone on henney

not knowing how to act

i feel like i’m on the f+cking appalachian mountains

i’ma go to naples just to say i made it here

[verse 1]

all right

i’m in the himalayas

just left the caribbean

i went to the mediterranean

her soul, she got her issues

like, i don’t know

she’s everything that makes you dance

pay issues

and i love her f+cking skyline

reminds me of my picks back home

honking weird like that

no time to . . . past home

now i am counting these stacks

like this is my zone

and everything i do

i just put it on . . .

on the f+cking bobber

knowing it is moving my boulder

da+da+da+da+data

i say i’m not with my cell phone

you can’t reach me now but

please proceed with your call

your call

i’ll reach you back

i’m not with my phone

you can’t, you can’t reach me now

but it is like

monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday

i stay busy, i stay counting

i stay stacking, i stay lounging

i stay doing everything bulging

the bag in candid now

and i’m back in this county

and i’m making that counting

and i am acting like this is not the coming

we don’t be counting like we cheesy

i am with the chisel

so i had to go for the babe

like she was the d+mn best from the start

that’s the rest

i’ll keep it with the middle

like i left the f+cking index

cos i must be f+cking moving

till i’ll stick that ring on the pinkie

and i’ll look back to the time

when it was just you and i

and i thought we had everything

but the f+cking love

now we got the stacks

and we have the love

what’s that

it is just the decibels going higher

till we hit the roof

so i don’t play

so i don’t choke

i just keep with the stacking

i just keep with the mapping

i just keep with the laughter

i don’t let n0body put me on a doobie

can’t fly

i don’t let n0body put me on a rover

that ain’t got no name

we still roll in this b+tch

and i don’t really preach

i just do my own thing

just to say i’m that rich

and i don’t even play with a frown

cos i’m not for that

i’m just with the smiles

hold up, it is the boy like

i’m not on my cell phone

you can’t reach me now

but you can leave a message

i am stuck at the melee in youth

i don’t really go that way

but i am probably on some f+cking dmt now

i’m just trippin’

eh?
