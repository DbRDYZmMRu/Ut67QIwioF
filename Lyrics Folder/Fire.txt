[intro]

wait

fresh boy chilling

how can she say it’s forever

and still need a bunch of this


[verse 1]

fire

i say there is fire

no one is coming

i say there is fire

fire in my loins

fire in my heart

fire in my loins

i’ve got none

no water

burning louder

and now you make it

want it seem this dire in

i’m getting away

i don’t get in her way

cos it’s fire

and it’s burning

down deny it

how you want to give me here

[verse 2]

and i love it when i see your face

taking a taste

just the big enough

hiding in the shadow of the lace

these drugs you make me take

boy you ever gon feel the same

jouissance, and i’m all for it

going down

not on my appetite for your love

filling up every hole

that’s making up for playing your board

it’s all about that comes this wood

and i’m hoping it’s true

cos it’s burning

and this water in my heart

it is not the water you know

just say that i’m dirty soul
