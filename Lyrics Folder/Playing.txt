[chorus]

and she thinks

i’m slovenly

when it comes to loving

my drums don’t beat

to the odyssey

it’s all puffing

and do you say

truant heart leaves you longing

in my love

it sucks to conquering

wanna hit it like

talking, talking

wanna hit it like

playing, playing girl

wanna hit it like

loving, loving

wanna hit it like

[bridge]

do you feel . . . (loving you)

how i feel

when you go all the way (oh whoa oh)


[verse 1]

breathing

want your love

got me faded

i can’t wait (can’t wait)

i can’t wait (can’t wait)

waiting on your love

got me faded

i can’t wait (fading)

i can’t wait

oh oh oh oh oh

at to me like

you’re free for eastern

holding me like

you are the first light

holding me girl (holding me girl)

just holding me girl (holding me girl)

just holding me girl


[chorus]

and she thinks

i’m slovenly

when it comеs to loving

my drums don’t beat

to the odyssey

it’s all puffing

and do you say

truant hеart leaves you longing

in my love

it sucks to conquering

wanna hit it like

playing, playing girl (talking, talking)

wanna hit it like

talking, talking girl (playing, playing girl)

wanna hit it like

playing, loving, loving

[outro]

with you girl (into you)

my heart hither (with you girl)

under the shade (with you girl)

with you girl

the shay (with you girl)
