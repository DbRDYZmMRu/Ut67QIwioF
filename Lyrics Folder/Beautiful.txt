gateau tender fall

banderole letter full

battle miracle


[verse 1]

it is a beanie on a ghost

find out we winning

we on our toast

and that’s not a post

um, her cruise

ever cared to undress a prose

take a rose and float a boat

her pathos, nouveau, my veil

her romance, fiddle me up in taints

[bridge]

please clad to her toes

tweeds gratuitous down her dose

oh sully her hands
