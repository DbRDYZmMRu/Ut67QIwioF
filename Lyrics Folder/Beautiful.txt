Capsule beautiful

Gateau tender fall

Banderole letter full

Battle miracle

[verse 1]

It is a beanie on a ghost

Find out we winning

We on our toast

And that’s not a post

Um, her cruise

Ever cared to undress a prose

Take a rose and float a boat

Her pathos, nouveau, my veil

Her romance, fiddle me up in taints

[bridge]

Please clad to her toes

Tweeds gratuitous down her dose

Oh sully her hands

[chorus]

Capsule beautiful

Gateau tender fall

Bandеrole letter full

Battlе miracle

[chorus]

Capsule beautiful

Gateau tender fall

Banderole letter full

Battle miracle

[chorus]

Capsule beautiful

Gateau tender fall

Banderole letter full

Battle miracle
