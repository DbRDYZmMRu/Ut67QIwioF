[verse 1]

will you meet me up

when the time comes

trailing up soul to brooch

the bridge

left a faint saint of my wrongs

to my clabbers and argons

i’m picking acorns

am i closer to you

bearing a dreck clue

holding mettle

coming closer to you

[bridge]

saw the mumps

bore the odds

coming off

who am i to you

saw the mumps

bore the odds

coming off

who am i to you


[chorus]

she knows i can leave it

it’s silver all gone

now hear the real bit

bureau soul

we roll now


[verse 2]

so, i’ll be back to the start

if i never had a map

the soul left in my heart

where you was at

rad at the positive to my love

never lacked the light

we just took it

and we rolled with that

something like a favourite hat

keep the blinding out

heaven here a k!lling

in and never

brick i dig a leak

tell a pane

we setting off the shore in reverend

are we, are we

still gonna find it

when we don’t ever hear the messed line

are we, are we

still gonna find it

when we can’t even lay a date to my heart

are we, are we

[bridge]

saw the mumps

bore the odds

coming off

who am i to you

saw the mumps

bore the odds

coming off

who am i to you


[chorus]

she knows i can leave it

it’s silver all gone

now hear the real bit

bureau soul

we roll now
