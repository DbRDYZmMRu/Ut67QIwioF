[intro]

i am here all alone

thinking of you

your smile

your mona lisa smile


[verse 1]

hey there mona lisa

can i have your time

hurt alissa

never get hurt

dad there is no receipt

she never leaves me; gone

weighed down busy

and my thoughts always right

and my loss on the sawdust

tune raid vim

we’ll be fine

stay with me

h+llo mona lisa

h+llo mona lisa

can i have your name

my only mood now

h+llo mona lisa

h+llo mona lisa

can i have your ears right now

i don’t wanna wake up

travel day, type of day

i don’t wanna wake up

cab or car

my calling card

[verse 2]

deep in the sea uneducated

hide on two

my mind is always lost on your twos

making up your face tease

it’s all i ever do

i don’t really know

what a seal, what a fool

think i’m a fool for you

make a heart beep

but for you

most of the time

i’m la+la lover

hand your name
