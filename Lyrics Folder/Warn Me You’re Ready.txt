[verse 1]

i ‘on’t need no stop

you can steal the family if you’re neater

my mind is like a roller coaster

i can spin it with these wills

i can never stop

hop it

up it

step in like a popping

uh+huh!

i’m pulse in

pulsing

took into the rein

i’m creeping on your love

who’s there?

it is the parley

she used to be my shorty

tryna find

who’s gonna cook your lobbying

who’s there?

n0body

just me and my shorty

tryna find who’s gonna creep on your lobby like

trapping lit

bel+air crib

she got a face that makes you wanna puke

never heard the one

something like a mute

so i put thе f+cking gold on the deal

duty

something not so hеavy

my love on the conduit you headed

hover over it

over it

[outro]

i love it

and it ends like

yeah

i like that breath thing

just warn me you’re ready
