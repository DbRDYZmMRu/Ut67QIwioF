[intro]

oh you got pain

beautiful meme

black final glass

you are the way

you always were

you make your cool gains


[chorus]

she says get that education

‘fore it snows me

how many bars till it gets real

demystifying the realising

she says spats in place

cards on face

call a date

[verse 1]

warts and all on balance

paul done dead relatives

cacophony can’t sit on this

i’ll refute it

bon sens opportune it

time mimesis

like you and i

just wailing

beat a barf

hit the dash

in the mine

fallow the line

be the man

lakе with a dan

hunches, me and mine

just mе and my train

all week

falling, dwelling, whirling

broad in

you know i am back where your loving

you know i am back with the love in

you know i am back with the loving

and i never go

any goal on it

i’m full on then

she in the bed

silver lane
