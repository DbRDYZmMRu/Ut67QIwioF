[chorus]

let’s go back to the beginning

even for a minute

can we go

back to the beginning

even just a minute

end it, beginning


[verse 1]

having you in my head blurs my thoughts

and it makes me feel like i can’t get another cut

no this this is not the court

it’s real as i feel, when i would say i’d do with the win

i’m lost on my own

sitting twice don’t mean i have figured it out

a waste

i’m shaming my freaking feelings

do i think it’s sieving

no whoa

it’s bigger than i had in mind

oh when you’re not here

i just want to come here and say wish

i’m wishing no i’m not p+ssed

i’m just saving this heart of mine

no i’m not d+mning not this time

i’m just feeling i can do better if i’m wishing

[chorus]

let’s go back to the beginning

even for a minute

can we go


[verse 2]

so i will pray today

everything goes and it comes my way

yet it fallls on my laps

like i got the world at the palm of my hands

even if it’s just mine

and i want you in it

blaming myself for too long

how would you feel when it’s not me on your songs

oh my i don’t know i’m towing

i just want you here with me like all the time

too messed up

’cause i’m too with the sentiments of love

of this love

love, this lover gains
