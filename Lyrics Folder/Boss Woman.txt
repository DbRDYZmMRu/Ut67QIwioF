[intro]

i wish i could go back

take my heart to the old hag

i would say i was better

without you


[verse 1]

don’t say my name

it don’t sound good outta your mouth

don’t call it pain

it don’t matter when it’s not a frown

i know myself

you don’t need to call me out

i know my steps

i took them right

with the devil, these legs


[verse 2]

too much

all you ever say is too much

who is hurt

i wouldn’t really know

i’m too bothered with others

i’m too botched up

you bother

but i’m still your spectacle

in this glass

tryna get a receptacle

whining myself out of my mind

out of my mind

is how i’ll love to flay

you do it, predict the way i’ll work hard

it’s all i will ever top now

[chorus]

why are my times loving all on you

why are my times loving all over on you

why my time loving over on you

why my time loving, although you ought


[verse 3]

hi, bye time

lover, wish you never take your turns

i should talk better

say you’re a boss woman

like he was better

walk away, yes i’m better

now i’m feeling like i’m known for better

i’m botched up

and my body is fatted up

i don’t know even know why i lost

it had a cause in . .

it’s my other my bothers


[outro]

oh gawd

i like it

now it’s time to just

write something on this beautiful tune

yeah
