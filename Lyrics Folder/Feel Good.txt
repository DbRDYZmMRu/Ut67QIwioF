[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

traipsing, this room for a while

i’ve been racing

wishes i had in my head

past, feels like it’s coming back

your face, i’ve been dreaming of a girl like you

a body like you move

asking for a new move

i found door two

the first being my heart

i love the scent of her feel


[chorus]

feel good chemicals

running through my veins

feel good emotions

had me feeling phrased

feel good chemicals

running though my veins

feel good feelings

got me feeling this vain


[verse 2]

oh oh

so feel this phrase

fill this place in my heart

girl it’s crazy being alone

i got a girl, we serve her one

telling my dames

son on a fancying cord

sticking with the rein

i’m sticking with the tank

with my fears

oh gosh! show me when i get in

carolina, carolina, cute carolina

[chorus]

feel good chemicals

running through my veins

feel good emotions

had me feeling phrased

feel good chemicals

running though my veins

feel good feelings

got me feeling this vain

(feeling good)
