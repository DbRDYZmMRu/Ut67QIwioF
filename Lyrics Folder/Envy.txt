[intro]

f+ck!

grand scene

mark: dream


[verse 1]

can’t see?

past whim

bootleg on that, it’s brim

had to chew it

deduce with perfect briefs

i harvest grieves

what’s this? the sheet?

mine’s all too fit

i, caramel off your skin

now you offer me a leach

not you off my leach

(she gets it)

on stead and steady

records with their postings

corners, nooks and bruvs

what is your implore

what’s this boy?

that man could be something more

but i’m bored

oh i took this doll, played that ball

we all saw . . .more scenes

don’t less your forte

i too sell rapture

was here before

was hot for temperature

let it go like the back of the never ending

i’m stuck in the barf of sucker ore in vain

i’m stuck in the back of something you envy

legos in their braids and their glues in the gules

chanting in pant, i weigh in the bills

jack a pack, like abs in retrospect

all too pet, she’s all too wrenched

i dream, what’s flea? that’s cheek

everyday is another better

cos that girl’s wettin’ up the fetter

fraca, back at her, come be that blat

what is more, you sure couldn’t be that
