[chorus]

i said all i ever was fed as a baby

was bad vibes

the bad vibes

all she ever knew as a kid

was crime stats

the grind hard

she’s k!lling em slowly

tryna die fast

it’s my life

the high life

cos all i ever knew as a baby

was bad vibes

the bad vibes

bad vibes (they ain’t hay)

[verse 1]

righting all your wrongs in dyslexia

cos he left ya

now you got dementia

what’s to mention?

is it the way he left your heart on your sleeve

or the way he left you to bleed

you’re awake but you can’t see

caught up in a swirl and it burdens me

he put your heart on a pedestal

just to crash it down

now the comedown leaves you with a frown

and a tussle with your demons

you try to place a call

but he never answers

all of the memories of the past time

hurts so deep

so you down another pill

what do you know

you feel better with the chill

better with this thrill

what do i know

i feel better with this thrill

i feel better when i chill cos


[chorus]

i said all i ever was fed as a baby

was bad vibes

the bad vibes

all she ever knew as a kid

was crime stats

the grind hard

she’s k!lling em slowly

tryna die fast

it’s my life

the high life

cos all i ever knew as a baby

was bad vibes

the bad vibes

bad vibes (they ain’t hay)
