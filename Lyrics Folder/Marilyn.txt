[intro]

hey, i know it

i caught the vibe

from the first time

i knew it

her cut off there in tight

i know i’m gonna see her dine


[verse 1]

bigger b+tt, bigger bun

she’s got a bigger bun

bigger bun

i got an ego bar in your bag

i think i’m not that kinda man

poor and a serf


[chorus]

fair race, say to mail

i got that level weight

i’m marked man

to say wear the taser

i got the siren in

i’m that marilyn

i’m that man to say i got a day in it


[verse 2]

wait, i never . . .

took a pity

sit up, my new music

we say look at it and listen better

and i’m always embarrassed

think i got a devil bat

i’m just kidding with a heart

that hands the demo rants
