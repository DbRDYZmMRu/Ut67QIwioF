[intro]

yup

no one knows that it goes down


[intro]

ah!

i’m slow going with the time

but i never deem nothing

they can’t ever bring me down

so why i owe it to these bars

sitting down

shimmy not her love

i hope someone hears me around

i hope this doesn’t take me down

oh it is just more coming down

these tears they write a song

a nigh hope didn’t get to you

or my loss is on a row

dodging, indulging

now, here we go

loving, endorphin

now i’m with you

we’re all ready to go home

[outro]

frith, you start all over from the beginning
