[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

damn it, can you tell me i deserve you

cos i’m right here

looking for a better view

by myself looking at my photographs

thinking how do i match up to the things i am

lover i know my beep

but whatever comes after

doesn’t have to be this

oh another lawn

another lawn to run on


[chorus]

so tell me that lovers don’t come and go

like they do on the tv

don’t tell me i’ll be just like

another boyfriend to beautiful taylor

cos i’m here with all my heart

let them rose on my sleeve

better than these words do

girl i’m waiting here with all my heart

pleading to you girl

[verse 2]

these days hearts don’t match up enough

looking like i need something better

to pull it off

damn girl, damn i think of some bucks

pushing your spray so something

like that won’t be enough

so gawd, i’m with share

more tracks i’m building

more stacks i’m building

looking like i could win her heart

if i’m dreaming


[chorus]

so tell me that lovers don’t come and go

like they do on the tv

don’t tell me i’ll be just like

another boyfriend to beautiful taylor

cos i’m here with all my heart

let them rose on my sleeve

better than these words do

girl i’m waiting here with all my heart

pleading to you girl

my queen
