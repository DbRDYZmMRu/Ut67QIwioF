[chorus]

let it down

it’s the eventual fall

let me down

lest i lose my course

and all my heros

they ain’t ever wrong

i’m never gonna turn back

at the turnpike

stake my heart

while i’m dashing out

swivel my thoughts

something’s got to change

all my pain

memories that stain

blotted out innocence for sane

remember my name

it’s all the same

i’m on my way

[verse 1]

she hurt me

love is so hard

it cost me

drooling from the reason

why i lost evеry reason

i’m missing every rеason

why i lost every vision

soul mates

soul not found

naysayers

hate breeders

living my life

i’m on time

tally on tally

yeah i’m marking out

p+ss in my tone

max it out

let em hear me out

here’s my reason

i ain’t ever bowing out


[pre+chorus]

all right

let it down

let it down

here is facts

here is facts

all right

let it down

let it down

here is facts

here is facts

[chorus]

let it down

it’s the eventual fall

let me down

lest i lose my course

and all my heroes

they ain’t ever wrong

i ain’t ever gonna turn back

at the turnpike

stake my heart

while i’m dashing out

swivel my thoughts

something’s got to change

all my pain

memories that stain

blotted out innocence for sane

remember my name

it’s all the same

i’m on my way


[verse 2]

push start the wheel

merciless k!ll

mask my feels

here’s the deal

ain’t she ever gonna know how i feel?

falsity!

lover you got my heart

yeah i’m all in

all my life

i’ve been riding s+o+l+o

let’s make love in an alcove

outta your clothes

i wanna be your one

you be my one too

let’s make this about us

[chorus]

let it down

it’s the eventual fall

let me down

lest i lose my course

and all my heroes

they ain’t ever wrong

i’m never turning back

at the turnpike

stake my heart

while i’m dashing out

swivel my thoughts

something’s got to change

all my pain

memories that stain

blotted out innocence for sane

remember my name (bash, bash, bash)

it’s all the same

i’m on my way (pay)

bash may . .

my way

my way
