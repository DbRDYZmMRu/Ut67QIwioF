[intro]

missing you

is nothing


[chorus]

missing you

is nothing

missing you

is nothing

missing you

is nothing

wishing i wasn’t this skew

is all i do

you rent here on my sane

having me see too

that kinda relate

or the same

in my head

is where your light on

is where you raining on

[verse 1]

eh!

hey there

you’re my kinda lady

elixir

a l!ck on

ore!

maybe the story goes

we end up purring our nose

i’ll make you

you’re coming

none on

oh!

and my lotus is alluding

my calling is on you

her paw you

you end up

you’re in mine
