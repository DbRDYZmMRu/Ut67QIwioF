[intro]

i smell dirty laundry

but it isn’t on me

nothing foul though


[verse 1]

liking how i get it out

it’s dark in here

i better let some light in

my talk is all of fad aided

validated

i don’t ever make it sway

appreciated, it’s how she brings it back

down on here


[chorus]

and i like it

like it, like it if she put down right here

and i like it

i could go out of my way

just to say that

i want to hit it in the back

take it right back to where you started

tell me how you love me one more time


[verse 2]

and i never switch

like, taking my feelings like put in the backpack

i never go out without my lunch pack

asking what i put out

b+tt over a dangling heart

lifting where i put my cart

and i told my lover it is stacks

[verse 3]

it is all i bring to the table

except you want some more of love

got my dear idea like a heart heal

say you want my sorrow dead

i’mma dry the laundry in the hall of perfect

how you like it

well she ever get it how it is perfect

girl, how you like it


[outro]

and i’m on here error

and i’m on here, a heir

like tidy
