[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

speeding through love

speeding through hearts

names on my dashboard

i’m happy that my windscreen is free

(free)

i talk a lot about you to a friend

i met him at the other fiery bar

(she’s really beautiful)

swear i fought for your heart remember


[chorus]

probably don’t know him anymore

harsh you don’t know me

these days i wonder

if you follow a decree in here

saying don’t be, we’re into

i guess i am alone with my heart breaks

i’ll find a way to say

i’ve just got a break from the most

from the most

the best cardigan i ever had

[verse 2]

everything turns around

when i look from the other side

driving this fast

hoping it will last

feelings coming and going

like the wind over here

i say i’ll be nothing

i’m over there

looking at another girl

hoping she’s not a friend

often, she’s just a fan really


[chorus]

probably don’t know him anymore

harsh you don’t know me

these days i wonder

if you follow a decree in here

saying don’t be, we’re into

i guess i am alone with my heart breaks

i’ll find a way to say

i’ve just got a break from the most

from the most

the best cardigan i ever had
