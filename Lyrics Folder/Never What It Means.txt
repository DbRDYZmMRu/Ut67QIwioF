[into]

we’d been whiling, whiling out

mad at it now

i could have get a ring off of you

made a thing of it

poor

we’d been whiling, whiling out

mad at it now

i could have get a ring off of you

made a thing of it

[chorus]

say this say that

say this, say this

it’s never what it means

say this, say this

say this, say that

it’s never what it means


[verse 1]

spiralling, it’s poor riddance

till we made everything

in five, we are having no meeting

dating funny, my link cutting

quid, so were you conversant

(sorry, i’m fairing)

pray on your kneel

it’s all you ever thought

spiel, oh once you heard it coming

i just pray you’re on your heels

so i’m everything

will you ever

poor riddance, poor riddance

(poor riddance)

till we’re bevy

wilt evеrything

(till we’re bevy, wilt еverything)

it ain’t your win

they know a fall, a victim

(they know a fall)

to a bae, me evicting

you’re everything

(you’re everything)

[bridge]

we’d been whiling, whiling out

mad at it now

i could have get a ring off of you

made a thing of it

poor

we’d been whiling, whiling out

mad at it now

i could have get a ring off of you

made a thing of it


[chorus]

say this say that

say this, say this

it’s never what it means

say this, say this

say this, say that

it’s never what it means
