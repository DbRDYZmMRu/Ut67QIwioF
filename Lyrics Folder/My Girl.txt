[intro]

it’s up now

my heel


[chorus]

my cuff is made of something like this

you and me

together

my talk is winning on pointing you twin

you and i

the better

we can let it roll

make a flyer

you’re on your way

oh my girl!

[verse 1]

tell me it’s not

wittily on what gone

point in my line

soul rake

it took too long

to severe from the high

had the hurt in you


[bridge]

sleeping (oh)

psst

it’s all written in your nabs

sealing (with your push)

she sowing onion


[chorus]

my cuff is made of something like this

you and me

together

my talk is winning on pointing you twin

you and i

the better

we can let it roll

make a flyer

you’re on your way

oh my girl!

[verse 2]

heading on

with a lot to say (with a lot to say)

she boomerang

she gets my way

hear me on the prayer


[chorus]

my cuff is made of something like this

you and me

together

my talk is winning on pointing you twin

you and i

the better

we can let it roll

make a flyer

you’re on your way

oh my girl!


[outro]

my girl (my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl [?])

tell me it’s not wittily on what gone (my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl, doorway)

my girl

my girl
