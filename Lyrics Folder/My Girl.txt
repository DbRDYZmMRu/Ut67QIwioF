[intro]

It’s up now

My heel

[chorus]

My cuff is made of something like this

You and me

Together

My talk is winning on pointing you twin

You and i

The better

We can let it roll

Make a flyer

You’re on your way

Oh my girl!

[verse 1]

Tell me it’s not

Wittily on what gone

Point in my line

Soul rake

It took too long

To severe from the high

Had the hurt in you

[bridge]

Sleeping (oh)

Psst

It’s all written in your nabs

Sealing (with your push)

She sowing onion

[chorus]

My cuff is made of something like this

You and me

Together

My talk is winning on pointing you twin

You and i

The better

We can let it roll

Make a flyer

You’re on your way

Oh my girl!

[verse 2]

Heading on

With a lot to say (with a lot to say)

She boomerang

She gets my way

Hear me on the prayer

[chorus]

My cuff is made of something like this

You and me

Together

My talk is winning on pointing you twin

You and i

The better

We can let it roll

Make a flyer

You’re on your way

Oh my girl!

[outro]

My girl (my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl [?])

Tell me it’s not wittily on what gone (my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl, doorway)

My girl

My girl
