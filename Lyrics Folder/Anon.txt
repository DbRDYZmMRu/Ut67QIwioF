[intro]

these weasels still

(laughs)

hang by the airwaves

say i shouldn’t see

hmm ..

you say?


[chorus]

you should tag it anon

till they bust it anon

my thoughts on:

you’re not holding

and another calls me

my hands don’t feel nothing

my calling is on you

[verse 1]

tick tock

tick top

big block

big buck

h++rding for something

that feels like

another tick in the block

when i’m lurking on the faucet

i can’t get this right in the night

my love in this not adding up

put the hurrying

an add+on

cos you’re . .

now you’re older

a toiling

the soul rein

putting in on nothing

all this is real

my commas

don’t say what i wanna say


[chorus]

you should tag it anon

till they bust it anon

my thoughts on:

you’re not holding

and another calls me

my hands don’t feel nothing

my calling is on you

[verse 2]


we should never let it go

this peace

this ease

we should never let it go

the week

my beam

you hold me nutter

you hold me under


[chorus]

you should tag it anon

till they bust it anon

my thoughts on:

you’re not holding

and another calls me

my hands don’t feel nothing

my calling is on you


[outro]

whoa o+o+o+o+o+o

. . . no i don’t want it by

i wanna go a different way

aw, aw . .
