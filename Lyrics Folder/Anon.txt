[intro]

These weasels still

(laughs)

Hang by the airwaves

Say i shouldn’t see

Hmm ..

You say?

[chorus]

You should tag it anon

Till they bust it anon

My thoughts on:

You’re not holding

And another calls me

My hands don’t feel nothing

My calling is on you

[verse 1]

Tick tock

Tick top

Big block

Big buck

H  rding for something

That feels like

Another tick in the block

When i’m lurking on the faucet

I can’t get this right in the night

My love in this not adding up

Put the hurrying

An add on

Cos you’re . .

Now you’re older

A toiling

The soul rein

Putting in on nothing

All this is real

My commas

Don’t say what i wanna say

[chorus]

You should tag it anon

Till they bust it anon

My thoughts on:

You’re not holding

And another calls me

My hands don’t feel nothing

My calling is on you

[verse 2]

We should never let it go

This peace

This ease

We should never let it go

The week

My beam

You hold me nutter

You hold me under

[chorus]

You should tag it anon

Till they bust it anon

My thoughts on:

You’re not holding

And another calls me

My hands don’t feel nothing

My calling is on you

[outro]

Whoa o o o o o o

. . . no i don’t want it by

I wanna go a different way

Aw, aw . .
