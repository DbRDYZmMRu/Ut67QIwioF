[intro]

oh, i thought last you

oh, can’t see how you care

do you


[chorus]

it’s my time

it’s mine, spent on you

to the last dime

to the last time

on you, on you, on you

my time, that’s spent on you

to the last dime

all my time

on you, on you, on you

oh+oh+oh

on you, on you, on you

[verse 1]

time not spent on you

to my last dime

last dime, i spent on you

wow

it goes the same way

i applaud this sh+t

that virgin way

i’m not evil

what you say you know

it is times, whose the same

you had to go

but i had to fix some plate

now i’m caught up

in the wordings of the betting

i’m not here

for the courting of the ferreting

and i really know

that it ever goes the samе way

and i really know

how always still

we say the samе thing

woah

can we just get it out

oh

does it need to end the same

more hire

my love, spent on you, oh

you’re retaining

pu . . . p+ssy

[chorus]

to the last dime

to the last dime

on you, on you, on you

my time that’s spent on you

to the last dime

to the last time

on you, on you, on you

my time spent on you


[verse 2]

oh i thought lost you

oh, i can seem not to get to you

dree, it is my time

mine spent on you, on you

to the last dime, i spent

to the last time

on you, on you, on you

my time that i spent on you

to the last dime

to the last time

on you, on you, on you


[outro]

yeah, it’s frith hilton

and i’m out
