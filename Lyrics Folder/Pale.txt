[verse 1]

can tell you ache

pale in your head

we get this

pray you will get

the tale you don’t owe us

pay you a visit

when i’m down

i still believe in

with you at least

i’m saying it ain’t fair

wherever you go

my heart, my sorrow corral your air

are you paying the luck a visit

take the preordained mile in

spanner we’re not toying

pair nah now?

no one now

not now

no one now

no, not now

not when we are now


[chorus]

with this heart of mine

feeling like a honey in my house

singing along the line

till you are ovеr here

i’ll give it all i’vе got

and noticing near foe

her day in the ache

her push for

[verse 2]

living, i am

ya’ll tube, oh ham

your tube, oh i am

been so, i am

pinning no hurt

pinning all these jams

no avert

to all for the rare

k!lling not his channel

paying no hurt

soul way, all for it

to fail in your waist on you

wondering how do i get through it

i’ll rest through it

how i go through it

pale, that’s not my girl

pale, lit, that’s how i’ma leave it

you’ve touched me

you are coming to know our home
