[intro]

sometimes love just

hits you

and you don’t even know what

a smack really, really dark?

i want it back


[chorus]

kim if i tell up on the bib

tell up on the bib

now they see the real me

kim lied, i’ll tell up on her bib

that this song is really relived, uh

kim lied i get up on her v

that this motion is rigged

kim lied i tied her up on a beam

get this, his emotion, he is wrecked

then baby how can i tell you

love don’t cost this much

is what i know for sure

how can i tell you

the how of your handcuffs don’t tell like this is a touch


[verse 1]

ah, come off bottle with my hand

take a sip and it’s not the end

i’ll wish you away for a girl every time

invent time, ending your time

[pre+chorus]

purple zone

couple ode


[chorus]

kim if i tell up on the bib

(bib)

tell up on the bib

now they see the real me

(real meal)

kim lied, i’ll tell up on her bib

that this song is really relived, uh

(i feel, it’s vivid)

kim lied i get up on her v

(lie)

that this motion is rigged

(oh, if you’re in love with the letter)

kim lied i tied her up on a beam

get this, his emotion, he is wrecked

then baby how can i tell you

(how can i tell you)

love don’t cost this much

(love don’t cost this much)

is what i know for sure

(can i have your word? it is for sure.)

how can i tell you

the how of your handcuffs don’t tell like this is a touch

(bearing your handcuffs, don’t look like this is a touch.)
