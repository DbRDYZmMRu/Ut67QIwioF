[intro]

yeah

fresh boy chilling

plotting for this wide

and i’m not gonna stop

i got a d+mn hide

it’s all on the puff

hey


[chorus]

she got my heart in a box

and she knows it

she got my love where we go

where it surfaces

and her mood is certain

i’m undecided, undecided

with these hours in

she got my heart in a box

she got my heart where it’s obvious

and i’m right here

i’m undecided, i’m undecided, i’m undecided


[verse 1]

with these hoes and thеse foes

and thesе look at those

i’m tryna get her hidden

like his evil morning

how she holds

she a whole zit

a hoe said it’s for a lap

saying, nothing while i make a song now

and i know that my is love not imposed

and man know that my love is all hers

all hers

but i’m stuck on the side death, undecided

cos i still wanna hit that

she got a ass that make a man

wanna pick the morning to the fall

mourning to the song

telling is it a fin or a haul

[verse 2]

oh, i just had to go

oh, i just had to go

with one on the side

often undecided

with one on the side

i’m often undecided

i’m often undecided

and i know where my heart lies

i wanna be a d+mn king

i wanna be a d+mn prince

and i know where my love lie

i wanna be a d+mn king

d+mn, she’s so pretty


[outro]

acting like a

yeah
