[chorus]

hop then it stops

hum off the top

stuck off the crop

tripping your words

such a curveball

plot in a thought

lump in a ton

tongue in a clock

lobbying

[bridge]

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

labelling me manic

uh oh!

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

all your words . .

crump tough!

curveball


[verse 1]

deep dip in the hurting

reading within

it all in

sometimes it gets so insensitive

my thoughts don’t mirror the way i’m apparent

i know that this is just another end

another end

curveball

oh oh

curveball


[chorus]

hop then it stops

hum off the top

stuck off the crop

tripping your words

such a curveball

plot in a thought

lump in a ton

tongue in a clock

lobbying

[bridge]

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

labelling me manic

uh oh!

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

all your words . .

crump tough!

curveball


[verse 2]

penning on all your rud in

utter or dither

lattеr on twitter

missing it all

it is all or nothing

and i know what hurts

the more it shows thе anger

and i know we’re freaks

pr+cks

the hobby

you should let it go

let it go

let it slide

we should let it go

let it go

let it slide

[chorus]

hop then it stops

hum off the top

stuck off the crop

tripping your words

such a curveball

plot in a thought

lump in a ton

tongue in a clock

lobbying


[bridge]

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

labelling me manic

uh oh!

you should forget me

coiling on your toll

all your words . .

crump tough!
