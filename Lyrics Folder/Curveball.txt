[chorus]

Hop then it stops

Hum off the top

Stuck off the crop

Tripping your words

Such a curveball

Plot in a thought

Lump in a ton

Tongue in a clock

Lobbying

[bridge]

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

Labelling me manic

Uh oh!

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

All your words . .

Crump tough!

Curveball

[verse 1]

Deep dip in the hurting

Reading within

It all in

Sometimes it gets so insensitive

My thoughts don’t mirror the way i’m apparent

I know that this is just another end

Another end

Curveball

Oh oh

Curveball

[chorus]

Hop then it stops

Hum off the top

Stuck off the crop

Tripping your words

Such a curveball

Plot in a thought

Lump in a ton

Tongue in a clock

Lobbying

[bridge]

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

Labelling me manic

Uh oh!

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

All your words . .

Crump tough!

Curveball

[verse 2]

Penning on all your rud in

Utter or dither

Lattеr on twitter

Missing it all

It is all or nothing

And i know what hurts

The more it shows thе anger

And i know we’re freaks

Pr cks

The hobby

You should let it go

Let it go

Let it slide

We should let it go

Let it go

Let it slide

[chorus]

Hop then it stops

Hum off the top

Stuck off the crop

Tripping your words

Such a curveball

Plot in a thought

Lump in a ton

Tongue in a clock

Lobbying

[bridge]

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

Labelling me manic

Uh oh!

You should forget me

Coiling on your toll

All your words . .

Crump tough!

Curveball
