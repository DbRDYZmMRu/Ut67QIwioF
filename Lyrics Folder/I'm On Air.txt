[intro]

check one, two

please don’t be mad

this won’t take more than two minutes

i just need a take

i’m on air

oh i just need to say it

girl i’m right here


[verse 1]

treating you like a slag

over what doesn’t have a past

do i need it

recall my words fast

tip back this door path

i don’t wanna say it yet

who i lied to

two hearts playing on my band

oh no, i don’t wanna say it to you

how i feel

the way i am weighted

the way you fell

you have a habit

i’m the fool coming here, ah!

ever something holding me

take her

d+mn, i’ll pay

it’s the doom, when me stuck

at the ground

with some beggar brother

oh no, i don’t want her back ah

no, i don’t want hеr back

i am sorry

oh maybe i am caught up in my head

probably, the way thеy’ll never harp

feeling like a . . .

it’s a drag

it’s a drag

it’s the tracks

holding my mind

got me feeling like i’m wack

oh no, yeah, she got me feeling wack

all over again

[outro]

it’s going

he’s coming

it never stops, it never stops, it never stops

it’s going, it’s going, it never stops

it never stops

my emotions are for you

sorry, if it doesn’t come vast

sorry if the pace ain’t low

discrete the wall

every, giving, you’re lured
