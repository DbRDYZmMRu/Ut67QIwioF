oh! no! pole

pokémon, yellow cabs

zebra crossings

i’m in the city

addy on, my anon

have a taste

i say so, it’s your reason


[chorus]

on a corny sieving

i’m waving it’s my reason

in sieving

she knows that i’m not leaving

can’t she see

that she’s still here

she’s still having the share

can’t she see

that she still makes me

wake up in the morning

looking for . .

what if cell like

[verse 1]

this isn’t it

this is zany

woke up in here

duvet is on you

disses ain’t it

this is the zenith

what could it be

if it isn’t you

pokémon, yellow cabs

selling us on a lamb

i don’t really know

if this whets

positive, you’re my queen

i don’t really know

if she’s press

but she’s my green

i don’t know whose pot

but it’s enough raining

it’s no feigning

she’s my baby

today, come next

it’s her run

it’s her run

it’s her run

soul run

[chorus]

on a corny sieving

i’m waving it’s my reason

in sieving

she knows that i’m not leaving

can’t she see

that she’s still here

she’s still having the share

can’t she see

that she still makes me

wake up in the morning

looking for . .

what if cell like


[verse 2]

halo holding

oh what now?

pillow holding

all day hurting

every quarters hurting in the mind

you had to get your ass singing guileless like

how you never see a man
