[intro]

fresh boy chilling

let us get out of this town

we could say we wanna travel the world

i don’t wanna be around town


[verse 1]

fly away

get the crown

i get the frown

telling of a one

that i don’t wanna leak you out

how do i get another mound

this ain’t better girl

when i tickle by, it doesn’t feel the same

your heart reaching to his mind

now we’ll never say it

i can read your love


[chorus]

weekends always feel the same

sundays, it’s all the same face

i don’t ever see no one here

service, oh it’s all the same place

sunday it’s always the same day

how i never ever see your face around here

i could be the priest

i could be the preacher

i just don’t wanna be with you in the crowd

i could be the priest

i could be the preacher

i just gotta find you

[verse 2]

loving on me

how hard it is

when you’re not fading

wishing on a star

wishing i keep it

oh i’m hanging on a loose rope

dating over the same memes

and friendships don’t last

when i need the pane

how do i ever get out the window

all i am


[chorus ii]

weekends are the same

and sunday remains the same

looking for you in a crowd

i see a better way

i could be the preacher

i could be the priest

i just need to see you

winner face the crowd

in a crowd of faces

i just need to find you in a crowd of faces

weekends are the same

and sunday it remains the same

i just wanna be the preacher

i just wanna be

[outro]

(laughter)

man this guy is saying

and you guys aren’t vibing if it’s from theo

i ain’t deaf, i’m on some hurt there

you know, like i could…

are you through

we’re chewing chew

best behold
