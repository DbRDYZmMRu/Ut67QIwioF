[intro]

heed to my manners

tutee by my fetters

you’re new to my manners

i’m always on my worst behaviour


[chorus]

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong

[verse 1]

hey

timeless, priceless

how you got me with this icing

panning my name

i can’t find the right adjustment

popping in the city like i’m on pay

i’m pressed till they ask me for another chin

i told her i will keep you close to heart

she told me i’m with you

what you call a thought

chain doesn’t matter

hit it from the back

while i’m stuck in a b+tton

pouring in sun

sovereign real sun

a sullen real son


[chorus]

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong

[verse 2]

petty at this

bidding at this

often

i’m already in

you morphing

biddy at this

bet he had this

avid

above an in

maverick

he didn’t mind

walk the coal

he didn’t burn the sim

he didn’t mind the burning coal

ode he add it in

he didn’t have the meteor on hold

oh i thought they had it here

fire i thought they had it

never thought they had it


[bridge]

heed to my manners

[chorus]

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong

holding on to ya foe

i’m not coming down from relapse holding

she goes down

and she wanna take it in

in all wrong


[outro]
