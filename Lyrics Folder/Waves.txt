[intro]

family still indifferent

in pastime i’m feeling like me time

(laughing)

i just laugh when i see people dreaming of old money

to me it’s like whistling

but i’m being inspired by so many people

and my family has changed

that isn’t bad


[verse 1]

dancing with a mop

that’s a romp you better stop

when the beat comes up

it’s a thud not a whump

switching shifts still i had the chassis loose

sleeping slips

p+ss slits

it’s a missed hit

mating bagels, mind my microphone

loser pitch

that’s my stitch

still plying with receipts

impatient that makes it stick

reek ditch

frith back

whist! whist!

frith back

wish! wish!

missing time so precedent

far gone how callous

me, myself, and i

i say bye byе

piety that’s what’s time

falling in and out of memе

it’s time to let it in

myriad of wants

bottle for sports

instinct, mental prison

period, see+saw

looking like i got a girl from the seashore

you should have seen what she saw

brows off that pasture

meshed in shark get the picture

dui, an assurance that i’m still myself

probity bucks like who’s ever worked that shelf

make it rain like april

mines in store like reek of ill

thoughts off foe like dream of this

still rocking with the boom bap

parity live and let live

sip till i f+cking get to breathe

me on a jesus piece

that’s a sleeve ease

till i hit the slit

i’ma still hold every form remain lit
