[intro]

foul dock

croagh though this pleasance

we’re all at your door fussed


[chorus]

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

how do i earn more?

(my heart can’t leave the payroll)

want more

tall, to our home

woah

healing in your heart

it’s one and the same


[verse 1]

fast pace, lost days

it felt i wasn’t in my phase

how to lead it all

do i ever take time to pretend

that doors close when you hit on them

my calls, all my dumps

i can’t remember if it still h++rds a thing

if it solves a thing in my head

then i’m gonna pretend

his was the end

[chorus]

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

how do i earn more?

(my heart can’t leave the payroll)

want more

tall, to our home

woah

healing in your heart

it’s one and the same


[verse 2]

take my shirt off

(ever th+rn)

i never get hotter than this

singing note in my head

i can’t take my head off

my time is like tocking on a f+cking red top

how i need a shot

oh i need some car hit

hit and run

take my heart and make it feel like i go to burn

down i go, down i go

[chorus]

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

mind talk, mind talk, mind talk

all he’s ever done

how do i earn more?

(my heart can’t leave the payroll)

want more

tall, to our home

woah

healing in your heart

it’s one and the same
