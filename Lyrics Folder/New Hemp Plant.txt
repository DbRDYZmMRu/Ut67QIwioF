[intro]

fresh boy chilling

when you see me

i’ll say be there

when you see me

i’ll say be a doll

not just next to me

here in my head

not just next to me

(my head, winning in my head)

here in my bed

(my bread)

not just next to me girl

meet me halfway in my thoughts

(it won’t hit)


[verse 1]

top baby

she never has a feeling like a dull girl

(stunting on my plaintiff)

sweet shawty

how you have me up in the air

when i’m here

i feel like i’m smoking something

i don’t bail b

i don’t baby

ever come down

[bridge]

when it’s your love

i feel this is something morе

i feel there is something morе

girl when it is your love

i feel that it’s something more

i feel that it’s something more


[chorus]

remember the day you perched on my soul

and you promised you’ll never let me go

never let me go

(would you)


[verse 2]
