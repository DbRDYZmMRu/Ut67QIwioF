[intro]

feeling nigh touch over here

when i rub my fingers through my . . .


[verse 1]

skin

i want you home skin

girl can i get you

girl on my skin

how i feel doesn’t really deceive

how i feel doesn’t release

all these ease here

out in the crowd

i feel so round

maybe there is more about

oh i feel this is over


[bridge 1]

do i ever see myself so fawn

do i ever feel this out of mind


[verse 2]

willing, not deceiving

but this isn’t how i’m feeling

i don’t want this heartbreak

i don’t want this heart so forlorn

[bridge 2]

how it ever feels when i’m on my own

am i staring at save mе now


[chorus]

i need you

in my sin

d+mn, i need you on my skin

is it obvious

who i wanna save

he runs

is it obvious, i’m my thoughts

i’m knotted


[outro]

obvious, i’m not covеtous

i just want your love, girl he’s unto us

that’s cupid, girl he’s unto us

and he is coming with an arrow

and we got no bows
