[intro]

Feeling nigh touch over here

When i rub my fingers through my . . .

[verse 1]

Skin

I want you home skin

Girl can i get you

Girl on my skin

How i feel doesn’t really deceive

How i feel doesn’t release

All these ease here

Out in the crowd

I feel so round

Maybe there is more about

Oh i feel this is over

[bridge 1]

Do i ever see myself so fawn

Do i ever feel this out of mind

[verse 2]

Willing, not deceiving

But this isn’t how i’m feeling

I don’t want this heartbreak

I don’t want this heart so forlorn

[bridge 2]

How it ever feels when i’m on my own

Am i staring at save mе now

[chorus]

I need you

In my sin

D mn, i need you on my skin

Is it obvious

Who i wanna save

He runs

Is it obvious, i’m my thoughts

I’m knotted

[outro]

Obvious, i’m not covеtous

I just want your love, girl he’s unto us

That’s cupid, girl he’s unto us

And he is coming with an arrow

And we got no bows
