[intro]

the day’s pittance

far tube admittance

being friends


[chorus]

when everything is airy

tense

then everything gets scary

deuces are a thing

early spiel in sear hill

fair in chance

eliciting pearlyville

something beautiful


[verse 1]

i got that part

i got that heart

my love is not poor in getting apart

tail lit end, tail between legs

high lease end, now you’re gone

now feeling everything missing in him

a girl to take a chill and deal our chill in dealing

we could have our way

turbid, how are you living?

oh+oh

girl a mine in being forward

other, another

a step after another

i got this

oh why bother about it

oh why are you early?

. . . out of it

[outro]

a foot, another

being friends is well with the rose in

everything is scary

it will all end on the beautiful

everything is scary

roaring into beautiful
