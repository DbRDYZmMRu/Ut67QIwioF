[intro]

oh we’re here


[verse 1]

i’m feeling like i woke up

on the right side of the bed

bed, peer pair

i’m feeling like i woke up

on the right side of the bed

paired with peer

i wanna hear your thoughts

can you tell me with a smile

her lie is on purse

i just want you here

i need to focus on you some more

i got nothing but this rain pour

it’s had me feeling like

this ain’t nothing more

nothing more

and i know what to feel

feel, feel, feel, feel, feel

and i know what i feel

[verse 2]

i’m calling on your tel

but you say nothing

i’m all time high

when she know no reading

you know i can’t hide your theme

when you’rе offending him

theo wherе is your ass

it’s your sou

it’s fine, he’s fine

it’s just us two

and she knows

no zit on him

he’s fine

he’s fine

i’m locking it on you

fapping my pants

and p+ss on you

cure my thoughts

card, d+mn! it’s on you

can i hit you like a real junkie homie yo?

is something like that enough?
