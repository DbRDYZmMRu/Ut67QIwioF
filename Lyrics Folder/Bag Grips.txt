[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

maybe i’ll take time

to let this heart

say what falls under


[verse 2]

just some bag grips

got to get a grip

looking for beats

that’s another fit

looking for me that’s another kick

i think i found another weave

sipping on these waving tears

i get the stairs

oh am i on your nerve

i fear i am going now

and i say

i keep it with the cults

and i say, i’m not real in this shot

maybe it’s another shot

another calling heart

maybe it’s another falling nugget

[verse 3]

i just took time to see

what’s heart

what’s for asunder

a lover, a brother, a homie, your weather

a lover, a brother, a homie, your weather

i just took time to see it
