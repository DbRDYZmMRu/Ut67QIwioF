[chorus]

way in too deep in this to let it go

how she gonna feel

i might never know

on the d+mn road chasing money

dumb addict .

yeah

way in too deep in this to let it go

how she gonna feel

i might never know

on the d+mn road chasing money

[verse 1]

been got it

dumb addict

on the road

dumbing in the bathroom

with a couple girls who ain’t got no intel on their ass

(she teaches class)

how’s that for facts

she leaning and she rock that motto

lock her in for my entertainment

and her back in for the waiters

am on it like .

i vibe and rate her (vibrator)

catch a girl by her tail i

wipe her haters

watch she squeaks like thе wailers

while am geeking onto taylor

detonator

spindlе exasperater

a needle penetrator

sordid combinator

for her sheer altercation (altercation)


[bridge]

i’m alive and its all right

surf my name and you find it

i’m on mind

oh yeah

i’m on mind (i’ve been a dumb addict)

dumb addict (dumb addict)

[chorus]

way in too deep in this to let it go (oh+oh)

how she gonna feel

i might never know (oh)

on the d+mn road chasing money

dumb addict (dumb addict)

way in too deep in this to let it go

how she gonna feel

i might never know

on the d+mn road chasing money


[verse 2]

been got it

dumb addict

and you know it’s bound on pre

theo you know frith

picking like a thing

this ain’t no three

better dead!

ache in the ba

turpitude, cracker, primo

appellation winnow

potter’s field you go

emanated

a man netted

barn erase scent

thought up

dated missive

a man netted

barn erase scent

tot up

[chorus]

way in too deep in this to let it go

how she gonna feel

i might never know

on the d+mn road chasing money

(dumb addict, dumb addict)

dumb addict .

yeah

way in too deep in this to let it go

how she gonna feel

i might never know

(on the road, on the road)

on the d+mn road chasing money

dumb addict, yes in there

been got it . . . jones

dumb addict, dumb addict

been got it, hands down
