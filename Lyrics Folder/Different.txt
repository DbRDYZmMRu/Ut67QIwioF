[intro]

stay with me

i’m hoping that it’d be the more vivid


[chorus]

stay with me

i’m hoping that it’d be more vivid

i keep pondering

i keep wondering

if i’m on the right track

i keep wondering

i keep pondering

if i’m on the right track


[verse 1]

when i see you i get b+tterflies

come with me tell me that

i’m different

how i make you flutter

how i make you dream

what do you think of me

is it different

is it better

am i better
