[intro]

Stay with me

I’m hoping that it’d be the more vivid

[chorus]

Stay with me

I’m hoping that it’d be more vivid

I keep pondering

I keep wondering

If i’m on the right track

I keep wondering

I keep pondering

If i’m on the right track

[verse 1]

When i see you i get b tterflies

Come with me tell me that

I’m different

How i make you flutter

How i make you dream

What do you think of me

Is it different

Is it better

Am i better

[outro]

Fresh boy chilling
