[intro]

take it slow

peck my heart

over here

take it slow

hurting

a tape when you’re done


[verse 1]

it is jumping

robbing

a steady crowbarring

sobering

beautiful

heaven chute

i fall

i watch you mull

beautiful

an healthy dote

the rostrum i drum

[bridge]

a porous heart

a shim charm

a caret in the now

my tug grit

blob beau

my beaut tomb


[chorus]

how you calm my heart

head me forward revolving

i can cater away

oh+oh

how you calm my heart

head me forward revolving

i can’t call 911

no, oh+oh
