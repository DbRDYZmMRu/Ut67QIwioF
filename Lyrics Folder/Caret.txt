[intro]

Take it slow

Peck my heart

Over here

Take it slow

Hurting

A tape when you’re done

[verse 1]

It is jumping

Robbing

A steady crowbarring

Sobering

Beautiful

Heaven chute

I fall

I watch you mull

Beautiful

An healthy dote

The rostrum i drum

[bridge]

A porous heart

A shim charm

A caret in the now

My tug grit

Blob beau

My beaut tomb

[chorus]

How you calm my heart

Head me forward revolving

I can cater away

Oh oh

How you calm my heart

Head me forward revolving

I can’t call 911

No, oh oh
