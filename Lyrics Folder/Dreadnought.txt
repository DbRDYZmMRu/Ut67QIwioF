[intro]

do you ever see her?

her words? turbid?

do you ever see her?

her face?

do you ever see her?


[verse 1]

though you ever see her

my lover

do you ever see her

how i adore

mine so many times

my crimes . . . it’s not my rhyme


[verse 2]

ever read my words

ever felt that these words aren’t ever enough

am i words clear enough

do i come on the page

do i bang your eardrums with crumbs

do i sit well enough

oh i actually feel deep insidе in my heart

human, in flesh

like carbon basеd life

human, in a flash

[outro]

do you ever see her?

do you ever see her?

do you ever see her?

do you ever see her?
