[intro]

oh, here we go

oh+oh


[chorus]

yo, we wasted on the yawn

i count the heapy wrong

i see it every time

it goes and goes

and we make a round

youth is wasted on the young

i can’t cede it now

it grows, a nearer echo

animal, i am on my knees

i need you here

[bridge]

closer, told you that i can’t breathe here

exclusive, told you

you’re my love

hey pick it up my love


[verse 1]

i was flaming being the hero

how it feels

when i’m stuck in the back of my mind

how it feels

when i’m caught in the wave form

it is dirе

put me on my jewel, a girl

you got mе lost

in the back of your moves

i don’t ever say it

i just d+mn see it again

singing enough

can’t get it out of my head

sometimes, i want to get out

and scream it in the air

oh, she’s got my love sop and bounded

she’s got my love so grounded

i know river is unpounded

say that i love you

our horus, we’ll call it up

or wait that i will do it wiser

[verse 2]

girl you know

i’m that mason (oh!)

let me shut you out

let me touch that pretty ass (mariam)

i kind of love it

if i touch it

i’ma fly

if i feel it

i may get a life

ah!

tell me what you want

feeling like i got it, your door

i’m not right for this job they say

but i know that

i’m on my mode, 3+4+2

like running through this place like

bank, i’ma back you

bank on my money

code, i think

a jut, through with it

then say is four, for two


[bridge]

closer, told you that i can’t breathe here

exclusive, told you

you’re my love

hey pick it up my love

[chorus]

yo, we wasted on the yawn

i count the heapy wrong

i see it every time

it goes and goes

and we make a round

youth is wasted on the young

i can’t cede it now

it grows, a nearer echo

animal, i am on my knees

i need you there
