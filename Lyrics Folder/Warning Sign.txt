[intro]

he’s dangerous

he’s the one they all are afraid of

he’s the one that’s king slime


[chorus]

my girl is a diva

achiever (theo her verse)

sativa

dart retrieval

cram

every time i try to talk to you

i kept but noticing

only sea weed up faded off you

girl is it not enough?

we should take it, get it

roll it

have a warning sign

we should taint it, date it

meet up

burn the warning signs

[verse 1]

measle, pestle, this stall

this soul is your realm

me too, recall, this song

me in a current

i could be for another girl

but now is enough with it

i could be for another lawn

pit the son in it (pit the son with it)


[bridge]

petty, petty, you know i’m in

a petty faded pivot renown in
