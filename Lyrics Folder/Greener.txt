[intro]

fresh boy chilling


[verse 1]

staying in the same place

what’s the way for?

looking at the same dress

i’ll cop it

boss, i copy

you need that

girl, i’ll have it

it’s a hobby

wanna hit that hard

every f+cking time

and she knows it that i am

a loose sucker for her love


[verse 2]

you’ve got me

feeling bad when i’m away

take a nice picture

tell me i see the future too

we’re on the beach

i know i’m rich

you don’t gotta say it now

i’m tryna catch a fish

it’s no leak

the money is on seal

waiting for my wiz

she knows, i’m smoking this harder

oh oh

girl when i look in it

i’m never coming down

no oh

taking you ride on a boat

girl, it’s never еnough of the groom calming down

oh oh, she knows that i heart hеr too

loving her ways i never did myself

saying, i never say i’m groom for myself

she knows that

(laughter)

[verse 3]

i love her brothers

it’s the end of the day

they found out, we’re lovers

the crumb bout to mutter

saying, i left her at the grass

(greener)

telling of what becomes of love in a pulse

(it’s flourish, fluoride in my t++th)

i swore, it’s for sure, who i really am

loving this way, gotta make you take a purse

is that the kind of girl you love?

i say: woo!

i love it, i love it

not letting you go

she knows we’re on this

i love it too

how she talking to me

that’s my boo
