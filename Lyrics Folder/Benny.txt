[verse 1]

benny on a benny head

benny in a benny head

man over on where we at

id sake you got me in

benny with the benny head

been here with a healthy heart

where i’ve been

i’ve been in the back

how i’ve been in the back

in the class

i’ve been causing h+ll

and i know that i can tell

where it all ends

i’ve been in the back

i’ve been cussing

i’ve been raising up h+ll


[chorus]

benny only had

bеnny with the head

wherе i have been

i’ve been never never way

been near my horse hard


[verse 2]

help is so bad

i’ve been on my bad

i’ve been going never rare real fast

dance with me

she’ll never @ to me

my heart is with me

i could like kiss the undead

in a sunlit room

nothing shows

where you go

[bridge]

my shadow is the window

and it shows

my shadow, it’s the window

when it shows


[outro]

benny had a hat

it was benny with the heart

where has he been with the heart

your spin

girl on here no pretence
