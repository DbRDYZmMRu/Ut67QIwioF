[intro]

it’s your boy theophil

oh+oh


[bridge]

you know, you know

how i feel for you though

you know, you know

how i feel for you though

when i am alone

i’ll be calling your phone

[verse 1]

she was in the spotlight from the start

headed for my heart with a dart

dozens of pictures got me nostalgic

love is pain

girl this is tragic

i don’t want my heart back

you are where my pulse at

got me thinking i’m bewitched

it’s only you i wanna dial

i’m behind bars for your love

behind bars for your love

i ‘on’t love no one

i can’t love no one but you

and i can’t get you out of my mind

i’m caught up in all these web of you


[chorus]
