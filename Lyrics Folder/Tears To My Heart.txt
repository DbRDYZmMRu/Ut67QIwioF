[chorus]

is that the end of our fairy tale?

do we get it . . . a gale?

do we get a rerun?

does your heart go baulky?

do we get a rerun?

do i get an understudy?

i’m rounded

come out running

tears to my heart

they do a hundred a day

[verse 1]

mulling, i’m mulling my neck

this breakdown

this wake crayon

heavy on

hurry on they say

i cry, you cry

hurry on

oh, we humps, we say

you cry, you cry

i try, i try

to buy my life


[chorus]

is that the end of our fairy tale?

do we get it . . . a gale?

do we get a rerun?

does your heart go baulky?

do we gеt a rerun?

do i get an understudy?

i’m roundеd

come out running

tears to my heart

they do a hundred a day

the horror

[verse 2]

hi, a drop from the sky you’re on

a cut

face in my hand you lover of vain

chase in the heart in the love of vain

tears in my whine and you love a cane

peek in my soul and you love a game

prix in my lane, ever enough of vain?

tears in my heart and you love a cam

check in my heart; can you love again?

shade in the high how you love a man

peg in my heart when you love again

tears in my heart; can you love again?

pain on the hurt, can you thaw again?

if my peak on the sea, would you run again?

tune in, turning, tune in

holding, holding, holding

loving, loving, loving

whoa
