[chorus]

just a minute turn a foe to a lover

she hold no back she acting undercover

covert my resolve

don’t be a terse

cups upend

probably gon’ end

this night out

back at my

back at my end

[verse 1]

how she likes it shangri+la

splitin’ thighs

hittin’ notes like ariana

harrying harder

with my words cookie cutter

mariana drunk

brain maim taser

an emotion shutter

grove dweller with an orchard of rose

yeah!

lash out my dose

how she trip off her toes

i ain’t nеver met a girl with a zing like that

parеntal role

how i keep that girl close

body on dose

only on those

am in love

i can’t get my hands outta cookie jar

fooling off a tutti cap

am a prop ingratiating with a prose

on the nose

i can’t get her off her toes

oh no!

[verse 2]

amanda love your b+ttons never fastened

not a gentleman but i could do the number

put me on speed

rolling on the wheel

cactus set the feel

heard you off the pills

i could get you wetter

tidy out the litter later

i’m boxed up and cashing out not an accident

i ‘on’t roll up

something about the room picturesque

i’m about that sh+t

you about that sh+t

uh

i don’t really know

my voice; sound up like a n+gga from the other end

soul real now i’m shining in a surfeit

mail pain, active chat green in a b+tton

chasing in on the feeling

what is it if it’s just a dohyo

screaming through a tannoy that’s it us wanton
