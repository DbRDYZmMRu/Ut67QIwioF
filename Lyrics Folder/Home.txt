[intro]

i’m making a song for mariam


[verse 1]

cos, of course i love her

i can’t deny it

she had me through the rover

that’s no bower

d+mn i get her right now

it’s not about when

she’s got me floating

this is so verdict

valid and i know

letting known

she’s the air in the moon

but i just wanna go home

and i know

she’s the winning comb

eff in the moon

but i just wanna go home

when we’re apart

can’t get the quay

yes, she has me feeling like this sorry

she’s everything i ever wanted

i can’t deny it

i forget every girl i know

i’ma freaking light it now

she’s the kinda girl

that make you ride, the chauffeur

dishevelled

like dance like it’s over

i’m acting like a codger

she’s my ever nova

she’s the colour sweating

on everything that i am saying
