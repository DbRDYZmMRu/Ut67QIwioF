I ‘on’t really wanna know

Girl i want you back home

I ‘on’t really wanna know

Girl i want you back home

You should forget about the static

Yea it started from here

We should fray away

What the b ttress

Hand in a medley lay

[verse 1]

Hands off

She was like

Isn’t it started?

Isn’t it started?

Piece of this dishearten

Now i’m in no way

I can’t take this expression

I won’t let it go

[chorus]

I ‘on’t really wanna know

Girl i want you back home

I ‘on’t really wanna know

Girl i want you back home

You should forget about the static

Yea it started from here

We should fray away

What the b ttress

Hand in a mеdley lay

[verse 2]

You should not takе it in a . . .

Having guesses

Bae, bae better

Down the old road

We taking it down the old road

We’ll be better as friends

Complicating making vis ends

I can’t take this expression

I won’t let it go

[chorus]

I ‘on’t really wanna know

Girl i want you back home

Girl i want you back home

You should forget about the static

Yea it started from here

We should fray away

What the b ttress

Hand in a medley lay
