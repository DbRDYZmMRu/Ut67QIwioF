lubrication</p>\n<p>he was in our apartment in severe grease odour</p>\n<p>my natural parents have a lasting sung discord</p>\n<p>so she moved into the other room on my relocation</p>\n<p>he’d come for her, I’m not sure what he’d to inform</p>\n<p>I was suffering a relapse and thought of the worst</p>\n<p>he was a mechanic just arriving from his workshop?</p>\n<p>for he’d slept out and a retired

slump</p>\n<p>it reminded me of the old sad days of distortion</p>\n<p>an event from 2018 back when I was handcuffed</p>\n<p>fed up, I had discussed about my resignation</p>\n<p>I’d to get clean from weed use, and a new drug</p>\n<p>crack-cocaine had thrown me into compulsion</p>\n<p>the wrong crowd ‘d led to my call for termination</p>\n<p>I’d a drug problem, and knew I needed a solution</p>\n<p>few weeks later in my studio apartment, still hurt</p>\n<p>in rue, I took weary pictures with joints in the mug</p>\n<p>I was by the window, topless, with eyes bloodshot</p>\n<p>and like my dad, I’d on a slim belt, but colour brown</p>\n<p>a friend had taken back a belt gift, as if to deplore</p>\n<p>on knowledge of solemnity; my new leaf resolution</p>\n<p>he Jinx was ruthless on a new air of demeanour</p>\n<p>an inexpensive belt, it’d take more to get drunk</p>\n<p>in oversized jeans, the picture still is an eyesore</p>\n<p>but my dad has helped me forge ahead,

it in the cloud off the Samsung</p>\n<p>I remember years later receiving a notification</p>\n<p>now drug free, having very raw mixed emotions</p>\n<p>I had been away from the device for too long</p>\n<p>the memories hit me to a new lonely position</p>\n<p>for dad was new, but ’d made me house shop</p>\n<p>all in my names, there’d be no date of return.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Come seventeen months later, I am floored</p>\n<p>by a princess few months from being an adult</p>\n<p>Leonor, Princess of Asturias hit my apricot </p>\n<p>her sis, Infanta Sofia of Spain is the bomb</p>\n<p>one day I could become king of their kingdom</p>\n<p>as if in a fairy tale, everything would blossom</p>\n<p>I’ll need to make it to Spain first past her chum</p>\n<p>but I’ve opted for being just friends in suture</p>\n<p>for the meantime, mum wanted this book done</p>\n<p>after spending a year plus in deep hibernation</p>\n<p>what you read now is its journey to completion</p>\n<p>it’s when I’d be allowed to move into my own turf</p>\n<p>uptown real estate, the gifts my parents bought</p>\n<p>a new business address, an office with elevator</p>\n<p>and my residence, a penthouse, it’s my mansion</p>\n<p>so mum’s got me connected in relevant sectors</p>\n<p>and dad has my word to be in Europe on tour</p>\n<p>maybe with both princesses I’ll get some jaunts</p>\n<p>after my business commitments, we could jaywalk</p>\n<p>I’d be well into my textbooks then and studious</p>\n<p>just as I’ve committed to dad, focused and bluff</p>\n<p>my English should help my Spanish transport.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So I believe in relationship accord</p>\n<p>having only recently been foxed</p>\n<p>my bottled thoughts sought shore</p>\n<p>in tow was an umbrage floe to thaw</p>\n<p>as criminals are not in extinction</p>\n<p>who is a stranger?

wouldn’t flay</p>\n<p>I criticized all who used until then, and lo, I too was raising Cain</p>\n<p>I was with Pimple, and we headed out past nine p.m. out my grain</p>\n<p>to everyone, I was in school, for I’d left earlier for the known gaol</p>\n<p>on arrival, we both went thrifting, and it went well with no complaint</p>\n<p>on returning, my new girlfriend welcomed me in slush rush fellate</p>\n<p>he’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace</p>\n<p>I’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image</p>\n<p>we loved a band, so she rammed their names

looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved</p>\n<p>with beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate</p>\n<p>enjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first

editing pictures, admiring my urbane</p>\n<p>for we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display</p>\n<p>confronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase</p>\n<p>outside

was grave</p>\n<p>returning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain</p>\n<p>across the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged</p>\n<p>a while later he left back for

said Pimple roused that bane </p>\n<p>he was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey</p>\n<p>he added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate</p>\n<p>all night he

marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes</p>\n<p>convinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate</p>\n<p>an unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate</p>\n<p>but I was making clean dough with no girl to debate</p>\n<p>Kendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate</p>\n<p>mull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate</p>\n<p>songs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>By third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate</p>\n<p>I’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay</p>\n<p>in a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray</p>\n<p>for I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay</p>\n<p>in stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained</p>\n<p>I wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language</p>\n<p>on weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane</p>\n<p>I wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate</p>\n<p>when finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade</p>\n<p>I’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate</p>\n<p>so in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed</p>\n<p>where repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate</p>\n<p>for new devices needed some of our service coverage</p>\n<p>with the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged</p>\n<p>the store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe</p>\n<p>you could walk through the three using some pathway</p>\n<p>it connected all three offices through inner doorways</p>\n<p>his office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage</p>\n<p>with the store leading outside to the numerous signage</p>\n<p>two ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake</p>\n<p>in house repairmen with records equalling certificates</p>\n<p>we’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday</p>\n<p>Hennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace</p>\n<p>I met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate</p>\n<p>I dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate</p>\n<p>and so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create</p>\n<p>a more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait</p>\n<p>I hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate</p>\n<p>but no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain</p>\n<p>so we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village</p>\n<p>it’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale</p>\n<p>just a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate</p>\n<p>I was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail</p>\n<p>the little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates</p>\n<p>this was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage</p>\n<p>it was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage</p>\n<p>for she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes</p>\n<p>he led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase</p>\n<p>taking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain</p>\n<p>I continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled</p>\n<p>pulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign</p>\n<p>but a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade</p>\n<p>here is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale</p>\n<p>CV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape</p>\n<p>had a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste</p>\n<p>it was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned</p>\n<p>that afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate</p>\n<p>we were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate</p>\n<p>the price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate</p>\n<p>clearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate</p>\n<p>we ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate</p>\n<p>ending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate</p>\n<p>familiarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave</p>\n<p>as he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled</p>\n<p>we’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage</p>\n<p>showing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved </p>\n<p>for its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate</p>\n<p>no phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail</p>\n<p>oh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate</p>\n<p>I headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate</p>\n<p>withdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein</p>\n<p>we all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate</p>\n<p>he’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait</p>\n<p>right under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed</p>\n<p>I was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane</p>\n<p>so I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates</p>\n<p>I wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate</p>\n<p>but few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate</p>\n<p>cornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate</p>\n<p>it left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate</p>\n<p>my fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate</p>\n<p>there were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate</p>\n<p>narrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate</p>\n<p>if we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace</p>\n<p>we soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate</p>\n<p>the environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate</p>\n<p>he motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain</p>\n<p>the lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace</p>\n<p>assenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway</p>\n<p>it led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate</p>\n<p>back outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace</p>\n<p>his arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate</p>\n<p>a ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate</p>\n<p>we headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate</p>\n<p>we both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate</p>\n<p>an in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A</p>\n<p>he’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate</p>\n<p>we went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray</p>\n<p>at a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate</p>\n<p>slothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed</p>\n<p>with a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed</p>\n<p>also uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake</p>\n<p>to me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate</p>\n<p>he was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate</p>\n<p>the question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase</p>\n<p>in deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate</p>\n<p>and I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane</p>\n<p>ever true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail</p>\n<p>so also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake</p>\n<p>it meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced</p>\n<p>no village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained</p>\n<p>in my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate</p>\n<p>with Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes</p>\n<p>with the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date</p>\n<p>every song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate</p>\n<p>the close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet</p>\n<p>and in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate</p>\n<p>my final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey!</p>\n<p>not quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate</p>\n<p>it’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins</p>\n<p>averting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay</p>\n<p>this stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate</p>\n<p>for it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine</p>\n<p>a reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde</p>\n<p>I fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Final year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage</p>\n<p>I made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade</p>\n<p>I remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage</p>\n<p>I had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate</p>\n<p>the fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate</p>\n<p>but I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape</p>\n<p>my studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail</p>\n<p>but the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged</p>\n<p>on the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade</p>\n<p>their plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate</p>\n<p>for an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade</p>\n<p>for my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale</p>\n<p>a well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane</p>\n<p>maybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace</p>\n<p>a particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint</p>\n<p>I met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray</p>\n<p>as always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate</p>\n<p>his speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate</p>\n<p>showing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage </p>\n<p>his records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained</p>\n<p>simple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain </p>\n<p>his scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database</p>\n<p>I’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate</p>\n<p>he’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake</p>\n<p>he answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate</p>\n<p>I’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed</p>\n<p>it brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main</p>\n<p>thanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The English lecturer I bet did exactly the same</p>\n<p>she made it look like a come of age soul stain</p>\n<p>the music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate</p>\n<p>I am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain</p>\n<p>a charge my current effort has debased</p>\n<p>what they thought did, never had me fazed</p>\n<p>not until trauma hit and I responded in slate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both first and final year had glops of unneeded strain</p>\n<p>as a fresher because I expected a porous membrane</p>\n<p>finals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed </p>\n<p>at no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim</p>\n<p>I was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain</p>\n<p>when the final days came of documenting and bye waves</p>\n<p>mine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste</p>\n<p>I was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail</p>\n<p>it got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes</p>\n<p>I got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté</p>\n<p>stripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate </p>\n<p>reading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage</p>\n<p>a friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the first semester ended, we created some straits</p>\n<p>by we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate</p>\n<p>maybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane</p>\n<p>as a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate</p>\n<p>no more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate</p>\n<p>I read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange</p>\n<p>and I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage</p>\n<p>and here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake</p>\n<p>pay some money to get graded only distinctions straight</p>\n<p>it was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date</p>\n<p>it was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay</p>\n<p>my first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate</p>\n<p>but our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay</p>\n<p>and plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate</p>\n<p>making the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade</p>\n<p>but my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged</p>\n<p>talks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage</p>\n<p>so the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames</p>\n<p>our worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate</p>\n<p>no one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate</p>\n<p>in our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate</p>\n<p>hell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay</p>\n<p>he suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid</p>\n<p>of everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint</p>\n<p>I believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves</p>\n<p>round the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates</p>\n<p>but for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains</p>\n<p>left me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage</p>\n<p>it would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate</p>\n<p>I just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave</p>\n<p>younger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase</p>\n<p>it was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Looking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage</p>\n<p>Code Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage</p>\n<p>reimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate</p>\n<p>a prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage</p>\n<p>he made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail</p>\n<p>my first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage</p>\n<p>it was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade</p>\n<p>he, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage</p>\n<p>and so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage</p>\n<p>the bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake</p>\n<p>one year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate</p>\n<p>another roommate detested him, everything for his sake</p>\n<p>he perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake</p>\n<p>the polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed</p>\n<p>everyone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet</p>\n<p>he gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid</p>\n<p>it’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze</p>\n<p>he’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade</p>\n<p>a love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became</p>\n<p>she hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane</p>\n<p>until he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate</p>\n<p>for they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage</p>\n<p>a Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake</p>\n<p>with the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate</p>\n<p>he then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake</p>\n<p>I wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message</p>\n<p>Baboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage</p>\n<p>you’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday?</p>\n<p>he thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate</p>\n<p>ladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale</p>\n<p>I should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate</p>\n<p>an eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage</p>\n<p>teachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate</p>\n<p>then I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate</p>\n<p>flaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate</p>\n<p>to be stuck in the mirror phase,

come, sing lullabies as he’d, so regaled</p>\n<p>wasn't on my acrid blacklist, the fella could pass for gay</p>\n<p>a seemingly gay man won't steal, not a buddy, do they?</p>\n<p>but when the

opposite room for security detail</p>\n<p>ten years older, counting, ATM his sound grate</p>\n<p>I needed someone older and with arms to excoriate</p>\n<p>I assumed he’d gotten the name as a local magnate</p>\n<p>adding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay</p>\n<p>or a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid</p>\n<p>he’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays</p>\n<p>of wasted years at other universities and of that pain</p>\n<p>lethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage</p>\n<p>I felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate</p>\n<p>he helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates</p>\n<p>seamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake</p>\n<p>it felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male</p>\n<p>nothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days</p>\n<p>summer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh?</p>\n<p>you could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe?</p>\n<p>he had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate</p>\n<p>she was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley</p>\n<p>also his name—an initialism—leaned towards the profane</p>\n<p>as a pothead years later, he showed his nay and distaste</p>\n<p>so we’d a fall out, I wasn’t a bad kid, a sort of young mage</p>\n<p>out alone at night, watching the stars twinkling softly back</p>\n<p>it was just recently I got word from the world of the literate</p>\n<p>a book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate</p>\n<p>it described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage</p>\n<p>it was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>His room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state</p>\n<p>his roomie, a real life giant on his own

</p>\n<p>I never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed</p>\n<p>and when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate</p>\n<p>but before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary

hung around anyone who wouldn’t flay\nI criticized all who used until then, and lo, I too was raising Cain\nI was with Pimple, and we headed out past nine p.m. out my grain\nto everyone, I was in school, for I’d left earlier for the known gaol\non arrival, we both went thrifting, and it went well with no complaint\non returning, my new girlfriend welcomed me in slush rush fellate\nhe’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace\nI’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image\nwe loved a band, so she rammed their names at me, time and again\nI enjoyed One Direction’s music, so it helped me to consolidate\nwhen his girl arrived, we headed out with his dad’s car in carnage\nthe venue bustled, but he convinced clubbing ends the mundane\nby midnight we could go in, then we would enjoy the sound buffet\nhe’d left for the barbecue, leaving his girl, who’s somewhat soignée\nI looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved\nwith beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate\nenjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first time, I could be frail\na few inches away, his girl struck chords for one to contemplate\nshe was beautiful, and made the night slow, then an accelerate\narmed men appeared, I was editing pictures, admiring my urbane\nfor we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display\nconfronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase\noutside the venue, he shoved me into his car, I felt like a renegade\nI was shaken, a nightmare—it is not my favourite night to recreate\nhe said nothing, we’d been away for minutes, the silence was grave\nreturning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain\nacross the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged\na while later he left back for the hotel across, he’d to plant a grenade\nI was sure he had one, for the fright stage was a real soul freight\nscared in the car alone, clueless in the new silence, I try an escape\nfurtive, I opened the door, and got out of sight as if to quickly email\nthis side of the road was lonely, so I went across for the said mail\nI hid behind cars by the hotel’s entrance, on their exit, I’d be veiled\non the other lane, his car stood alone and it sure wasn’t a shay\nI wasn’t getting married, for the groom had left his bride astray\nsome more shots went off and he darted out as someone caned\nspeeding off with the other police men in a mind calming rampage.\n\n\nPimple had left me, still the hotel’s crowd weren’t awry or drained\nI got my phone back hours later; the reason of arrest wasn’t plain\nno official reason was given, none was convincing, or hit the nail\na dude took me home that night, he said Pimple roused that bane \nhe was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey\nhe added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate\nall night he smoked pot, with his house on a course to dilapidate\nhe complained about his old mother, it was our convo’s punctuate\nshe, his doom in life, he believed he wasn’t birthed, but arraigned\nhis whining dragged for a while, and I refused his indignance plate\nas I was sleepy, I did get to sleep, but not without his rant’s delay\nwhen the day broke, he led me to Pimple’s house like an associate\nhe’d claimed he knew Pimple, as if his identity wasn’t at all private\nnot convinced, but for their proximately close residential estates\nhe said little on our way, having been turgid, maybe not to conflate\nby Pimple’s house gate, I saw his patient waiting as if to acculturate\nhe’d done enough, he’d been nice, but going on was to constipate\nI got received and he said bye, I was glad my opinions didn’t remain\nmy parents arrived, he said, he hadn’t expected the events’ chain.\n \nI knew university could be anything as I could variate\nso I often made money on the side without any refrain\nmaking beats, audio mixing, it provided me with a cape\nat times resetting stolen or bad devices, I never feigned\nopposite my room, drugs got labelled and repackaged\nbeing a famous pot head, whom nothing did infatuate\nyou’d find me in my room, screen facing past average\na good number were convinced I’d found my own way\ncome graduation, they saw a repairman in the range\na marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes\nconvinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate\nan unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate\nbut I was making clean dough with no girl to debate\nKendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate\nmull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate\nsongs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.\n \nBy third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate\nI’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay\nin a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray\nfor I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay\nin stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained\nI wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language\non weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane\nI wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate\nwhen finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade\nI’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.\n \nFor a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate\nso in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed\nwhere repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate\nfor new devices needed some of our service coverage\nwith the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged\nthe store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe\nyou could walk through the three using some pathway\nit connected all three offices through inner doorways\nhis office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage\nwith the store leading outside to the numerous signage\ntwo ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake\nin house repairmen with records equalling certificates\nwe’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday\nHennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.\n \nJust outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace\nI met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate\nI dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate\nand so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create\na more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait\nI hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate\nbut no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain\nso we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.\n \nPortending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village\nit’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale\njust a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate\nI was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail\nthe little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates\nthis was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage\nit was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage\nfor she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes\nhe led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase\ntaking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain\nI continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled\npulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign\nbut a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade\nhere is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale\nCV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape\nhad a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste\nit was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned\nthat afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate\nwe were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate\nthe price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate\nclearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate\nwe ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate\nending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate\nfamiliarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave\nas he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled\nwe’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage\nshowing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved \nfor its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate\nno phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail\noh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate\nI headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate\nwithdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein\nwe all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate\nhe’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait\nright under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed\nI was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane\nso I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates\nI wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate\nbut few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate\ncornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate\nit left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate\nmy fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate\nthere were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.\n \nA new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate\nnarrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate\nif we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace\nwe soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate\nthe environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate\nhe motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain\nthe lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace\nassenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway\nit led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate\nback outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace\nhis arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate\na ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate\nwe headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate\nwe both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.\n \nBefore internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate\nan in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A\nhe’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate\nwe went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray\nat a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate\nslothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed\nwith a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed\nalso uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake\nto me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate\nhe was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate\nthe question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase\nin deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate\nand I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane\never true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.\n \nMy growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail\nso also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake\nit meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced\nno village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained\nin my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate\nwith Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes\nwith the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date\nevery song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate\nthe close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet\nand in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate\nmy final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey!\nnot quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate\nit’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins\naverting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay\nthis stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate\nfor it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine\na reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde\nI fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.\n \nFinal year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage\nI made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade\nI remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage\nI had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate\nthe fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate\nbut I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape\nmy studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail\nbut the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged\non the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade\ntheir plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate\nfor an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade\nfor my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale\na well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane\nmaybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace\na particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint\nI met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray\nas always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate\nhis speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate\nshowing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage \nhis records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained\nsimple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain \nhis scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database\nI’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate\nhe’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake\nhe answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate\nI’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed\nit brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main\nthanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.\n \nThe English lecturer I bet did exactly the same\nshe made it look like a come of age soul stain\nthe music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate\nI am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain\na charge my current effort has debased\nwhat they thought did, never had me fazed\nnot until trauma hit and I responded in slate.\n \nBoth first and final year had glops of unneeded strain\nas a fresher because I expected a porous membrane\nfinals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed \nat no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim\nI was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain\nwhen the final days came of documenting and bye waves\nmine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste\nI was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail\nit got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes\nI got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.\n \nFirst year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté\nstripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate \nreading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage\na friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.\n \nWith the first semester ended, we created some straits\nby we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate\nmaybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane\nas a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate\nno more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate\nI read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange\nand I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage\nand here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake\npay some money to get graded only distinctions straight\nit was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date\nit was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay\nmy first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate\nbut our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay\nand plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate\nmaking the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade\nbut my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged\ntalks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage\nso the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames\nour worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate\nno one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate\nin our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate\nhell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay\nhe suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid\nof everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint\nI believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves\nround the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates\nbut for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains\nleft me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage\nit would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate\nI just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave\nyounger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase\nit was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.\n \nLooking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage\nCode Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage\nreimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate\na prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage\nhe made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail\nmy first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage\nit was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade\nhe, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage\nand so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage\nthe bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.\n \nYou probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake\none year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate\nanother roommate detested him, everything for his sake\nhe perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake\nthe polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed\neveryone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet\nhe gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid\nit’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze\nhe’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade\na love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became\nshe hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane\nuntil he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate\nfor they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage\na Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake\nwith the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate\nhe then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake\nI wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message\nBaboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage\nyou’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday?\nhe thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate\nladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale\nI should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.\n \nHe gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate\nan eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage\nteachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate\nthen I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate\nflaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate\nto be stuck in the mirror phase, a rather pernicious vitiate\nour opinions differ, he shuns the empirical for “the planes”\nin his world, there are seven heavens, not seeing shrinkage\nwhere the demons conduct research then send out relays.\n \nI’d riffled through C.S. Lewis’s the letters from Screwtape\nIt’s all I have on demons, but he’d books one would wildly gaze\nit’s a certain plane, then unintelligibly he’d continue to narrate\ntrying to get people on his ideas, I’d muse on as if to speculate\nit didn’t feel right, they were fanciful, airhead’s ideas to iterate\nby nature, when speaking, even to his friends, he would orate\nhis brash voluble spiel seemed to go on in charlatan raves\nand when one knew about the issue, he acted with disdain\nquestioning only lead to him meandering, never to expatiate\nhis devotees referred to him as Machiavelli in the heydays.\n \nOut of university, I was sliving where I could incubate\nthe coder in his office, then I saw what he portrayed\nbeyond his pretentiousness, I saw the addlebrained\na thief, a barnacled liar, with only that to perpetrate\nit took a Facebook post for my hunch to perpetuate\nposing for pictures by a desk as if to claim the palisade\ncaption, righteousness got him a job, with images to indicate\nbefore his exit, he told me he’d need money for an assemblage\na man of God could help with his nose polyp, out to negotiate\nI gave him money, no fare—for he went nowhere—to acclimate.\n \nFreshmen, we’d special prayers from a book for a foretaste\nrecited before dawn, silence for holy names in interchange\nwe all adhered, and to our incredulity, in the test we all aced\nit’s a mandatary after class examination, a MCQ designate\nI’d the best score in class, a point short, and got a handshake.\n \nMy dean, a physicist got mad I never stuck to the rail\nhe loved my name, but I got ever impersonal in full spate\nI even started missing the tests, quitting the reg brigade\nI think he knew me as, “O Theophilus!” he’d call to begay\nhe could have helped me, but I was resigned and obdurate\na dull friend hit a jackpot score, laying his former in wastage\nthat’s the bunkie who acquainted me with the king of tutelage\nwith our scores in line, we agreed the book to be consecrate.\n \nBaboo ruined his brain, so we all needed ancestral aids\nI spent exam nights making beats, chomping Kool-Aids\nwith the pens not making it, I only had to trust the gale\nthe odd one that blows you cougar as you walk in gains\nheaded for the exam hall where memory is enough game\nsecond semester, first year, the mysterious to excavate.\n \nFirst semester was three points, next, two point eight\ncommitting my charms alone, it could have been great\nbut I let Baboo ruin it all, and have me sozzled on ale. \n \nI had no one calling me soppy names\nno cute masculine ones I can restate\nmaybe with their doors closed to fixate\nI did have girls after me in literal chase\nI mean it, every time I was hard to locate\nI was a celeb, circle police, razor shaved\nhigh style threads, to ransom—the stage.\n \nThe student whose ways, sways to daze\nfam or fan? do you, what do you say?\nhow do you identify? no long hangnails\nremember him or the cougar’s delicate?\nhis name was Fan-u, right? this is okay\nit was sophomore he became a roommate\nor is it Fam-u? oh of these day’s vulgate\nit could have been his name, a shame\nit is, he should sue, balk out my lame. \n \nAh! I had others, two more bed frames\nPimple, a junkie dude, and a squat splay\nthe junkie we called Cassette in homage\nto his early music slips and oldie storage.\n \nI later left for another; some blocks faraway\nfor a room all to myself, until the last quake\nof stealth visitors, well covetous to extirpate\nso I had a meeting that led to an abrogate\none over myself, in my head, a final cascade\nthe final decision was for me to repatriate\nfor the regular arrangement that’d placate\nor it’d be my Dell PC, if they collaborate\nI’d lost a USB modem in a rut clean rake\nit’d been a pianist fingers’ harrowing sate\nratted by one whose admittance is insane\nsparking interest in his rood seat to imitate\never worried of my weed high in longing vale\nboth church pianist through the congregate\nsat up in the chancel with the most bandage\nold living epistles salvaged from a mucky raid. \n \nFor their personalities, if you give or take\none scrunched the nose and took the pain\nother lost bridge and is tootles for change\ninfatuated by reeking fingers and going ape\nthe only one who told me, I only do opiates\nI’d be a different man if his crowd ‘d swathed\nmy weed habit would be alive and desperate\nMr. history, mystery, on a song I nicknamed\na friend of Baboo, ours differed in its vein.\n \nWe’d a bet, to fingerbang, to prove I wasn’t tamed\nher big sis let me to too, my move was to ingratiate\ntwo sisters, one hotel, good enough to substantiate.\n \nOf a late catch up on who needed to propitiate\nmy phone was missing this time, the scene taped\ncampus back then, was an anti-smartphone space\nleastways, until the bigot dean got with his dotage\nsoon, a jolly philosopher got his desired post aim\nthe new dean soon delivered the role’s new package\nhis short, endomorph habitus was a good instantiate\nhis mild thrash talk was awesome in advent of a shake\nhis daughter was a student, oh her ass beguiling pace\ntoo thick, with height from dad and all that pertained\nat the beginning, it was the centre of all the exudate.\n \nWith my smartphone gone, I pondered the trick in play\nI had no roommates, wasn't careless, with a lock in place\nthe buddy who'd come, sing lullabies as he’d, so regaled\nwasn't on my acrid blacklist, the fella could pass for gay\na seemingly gay man won't steal, not a buddy, do they?\nbut when the confession broke, from the horse it came\nit was a shocker, that no one but him could help palliate\nI expected him to help, but not a word from him to wane\nhis unsuspecting tooshie had done the hand-hang crane?\nwill I forget Owl City fireflies? damn putz he almost ate. \n \nAfter the theft, I moved on, leaving a skitter trail\nsame block, the opposite room for security detail\nten years older, counting, ATM his sound grate\nI needed someone older and with arms to excoriate\nI assumed he’d gotten the name as a local magnate\nadding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay\nor a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid\nhe’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays\nof wasted years at other universities and of that pain\nlethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage\nI felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate\nhe helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates\nseamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake\nit felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male\nnothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days\nsummer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh?\nyou could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe?\nhe had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate\nshe was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley\nalso his name—an initialism—leaned towards the profane\nas a pothead years later, he showed his nay and distaste\nso we’d a fall out, I wasn’t a bad kid, a sort of young mage\nout alone at night, watching the stars twinkling softly back\nit was just recently I got word from the world of the literate\na book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate\nit described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage\nit was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.\n \nHis room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state\nhis roomie, a real life giant on his own thought train \nwith love for making beats, and a basketball inmate\nwas wishful, loved his mum and deplored eating steak\nI hardly knew the guy, when around quite the loud bait \nI never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed\nand when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate\nbut before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary tale.\n \nIt was a day like every other, I was out by my fate\nwith matters to attend to, for a whole day of trade\nID cards were being issued; I’d the day to dedicate\nfor weeks, I let the rush pass, as the famed reprobate\nonly I call myself lackadaisical, bearing my martingale\nweighing importance tactically, it’s the way to graduate\na Christian university and it’s high morals they proclaim.\n \nI’d mine now and lunchtime came hitting me with a mace\nI headed for the canteen carried in hunger’s plumage\na few minutes from the admin building sits its terrace\nI’d pass by the computer lab and colleges for a flambé\nbut no flambé though, it was about to be a robinsonade\nFanu would need a statement, it’d entail how to forsake\nfor he was about to hand me casted fetters of bondage\nhis bank balance was about to reveal his true portrait.\n \nUsing WiFi in the foyer before the stairs, the interface\nour eyes met, he’d just arrived, that didn’t need an essay\nhe was looking himself, formal, smart, and as appropriate\nthe semesters had toned mine down, leaving me desiccate\nif I was female, against the rules I’d still dress up a bit risqué\nhe’d shocked me a semester ago with what he purveyed\nbehind me, he’d made available to a colleague my suitcase\nthe fat dude with me the day I got swindled, it’s depraved\nfor he knew I owned the bag, my bad I flunked the presage\nI retched out my plans to him in a reflection dispassionate\nhe’d told me he’d need to run a quick errand to my dismay\nI said I was peckish, and if by his minutes, and to numerate\nfive should be five, no returning to telling me stories ornate\nhe assured me leaving no later wouldn’t be at all an abdicate\nnonetheless he would return on time, in an averring grimace\nI told him I’d leave if I’d to, but he reassured me in a palpate.\n \nAlone as the silence watched uncertain of its own pervade\na familiar face walked past and there was a normal exchange\nfive minutes turned to six with no sign of him, no coruscate\nI looked through the windows, employing the nearby dais\nbut no one was coming, my terms hadn’t been inchoate\nleaving it even with his word to, would leave me to blame\nit left me pensive, stuck unlike the Bible’s waiting maids\nI had no bag so I couldn’t leave with it, I felt like a glaik\nI walked away, no flinch, conscience clear by my undertake.\n \nHours later he caught me in an ambush, where he waylaid\nhe’d accusing questions, and no care at all to disambiguate\nthese things never feel real, I thought in my slow repudiate       \nI told him I wasn’t in the room with it, as if in expected cliché\nI left as per our agreement, I cleared, convinced it’d exculpate\ntagging me in a theft report? I’d add, of the type haemorrhage\nhe’d eyewitnesses accounts of my leaving with an appendage\nand of seeing it in our room, he closed swiftly to accentuate\nin a calming disbelief I snap at him in an assertive remonstrate\nhe’d gone too far; his accounts were wrong and also glacé\nhe’d alibis, I’d none, but I couldn’t afford the verbal tentage\nhe’d set me against an open block for anyone to castigate.\n \nAt the bench with every reason for his testimony to fluctuate \nthings took a decisive turn, as he left things out to abnegate\nthere’d been no alibis, which for me was a winning ameliorate\nwhen I called his attention, he slunk on in a baffling prevaricate\nthe house rule was not to interrupt, not to bring on a blockage\nmy account to the Control officers had earned me some brace\nat no time ‘d I been an offender, and his accusation ‘d no base\nFamu’s demeanour betrayed him in his continuous infiltrate\nas my honed confidence hinted at my own innocence saturate\nthe Control officers seemed to address him to subtly abominate\nas if to say his accusations had left even him too consternate\nthe case was soon dismissed after all due thorough expurgate\nin our hall of residence, everyone had questions on the outré\nhe probably needed some quick cash was the loud corroborate\nsome of his colleagues and hall staffs visited me to commiserate\na suspension in the second year would pass for a clear deracinate\nthe larceny investigation came to an end, soothing all of my aches\nin my room, the coming hours would help me unwind, to resuscitate\nI could be betrayed again, a new thing I’d need to legislate against\nI thought it’d be great to enjoy a drink, even if alone, a merry wassail\njust me, myself, and I enjoying one bashfully to lead in the exonerate.\n \nMy moat hadn’t been crossed; I was the aporetic trifoliate\nwhat happened next had everyone on a sleuthhound's tail\nFanu had run away, he had taken to his heels on mandate."

The yap\n\n     both here to help my move go smoother. \n\n    \n\n     Jinx who often is here, the rapper \n\n     and then Bode the man after Fela. \n\n    \n\n     The afternoon is bustling, cool, cheer, rad\n\n     and I, under the weather by the social graph.\n\n    \n\n     I was moving for the better bag\n\n    with idleness and a heartbreak past\n\n     remaining sober had been a drag\n\n     my apartment stunk in otiose tacks.\n\n    \n\n     Long phone calls, clients, crunching numbers\n\n     gig offers lined up, my attendance in panache\n\n     it had to be simple, I couldn't afford dysphoria\n\n     as quitting my job came with reasons; same tract. \n\n    \n\n     Weed in the tray to remain awake, not enough ash\n\n     feeble, falling asleep, dreading the circadian slam\n\n     past figures littering my after-hours office survival. \n\n    \n\n     A slim offering presented in good tact\n\n     the right earnings for the circumstance\n\n    what never quite found me in the brash.\n\n    \n\n     The fumes from the chartered starting cab\n\n     like the festering items on old receipts pats. \n\n    \n\n     Those of whiskey drunk with no chaser\n\n     reminding me of my generator's palaver.\n\n    \n\n     I had just sold off my bed, for crap\n\n     the luxury thing put me in a class. \n\n    \n\n     For a month or so, I slept on the floor tired\n\n     no reasons, I can't get to it with my keypad.\n\n    \n\n     On a bottle for days, I had expectorant\n\n     to knock me out as I finish with dinner.\n\n    \n\n     I got a house, but no bed for every relevance\n\n     my first home, today I move out a studio flat.\n\n    \n\n     I didn't have everything, I’d the dream ramp\n\n     the early days, a fresh graduate bootstrapped. \n\n    \n\n     After my graduation, I got a good job, no ads\n\n    my publishing platform under their umbrella \n\n     employed to work with my dibs, no contracts\n\n    promised a life with security, I even got a car\n\n     it was my first job before this one I now back.\n\n    \n\n     I continued for months as my salary got larger\n\n     I was over a hundred percent from the dash\n\n     when a colleague came to me with the draft. \n\n    \n\n     Our first meet was on a Skype video chat\n\n     with the colleague who came up on brand\n\n     by my advice of a social engineering tab\n\n     same course as I in uni, cursed to philander. \n\n    \n\n     I got the gig, someone knew; there was a rat\n\n    so I was being monitored for the slightest lax.\n\n    \n\n     Six times my salary, I'd hit on a formula\n\n     it felt like a windfall; an available capital\n\n     but a colleague cadged I invested grand\n\n     I paid for the fake crypto and lost a stash.\n\n    \n\n     The Christmas holidays came in a taper\n\n     prototyping, with an IOS app to deliver\n\n     not resuming; thoughts of a day later\n\n     my actions left me with only two paths\n\n     sell off the platform, still I get the sack. \n\n    \n\n     My wait by the carrel amidst noisy clacks\n\n     the brand rat with offerings, I remember.\n\n    \n\n     It was a shock, the sudden jolt waker\n\n     playing in there was heavenly ballad\n\n     with audio and visual studio grants\n\n     everything in there — a dream painter.\n\n    \n\n     I left not selling, pondering the beater. \n\n    \n\n     Than I thought, the mole was closer\n\n     a developer in a goss so unequivocal\n\n     allays to me in dismissing shorthand.\n\n    \n\n     It took me a very long walk to ponder\n\n    the rat had introduced us, it was smart\n\n    and I brought him in too, good nuisance.\n\n    \n\n     Calling for maintenance: the gig employer\n\n     I inform him of the retaining withdrawal. \n\n    \n\n     I am interested in a company, a starter \n\n     I'd be going in as a partner; a survivor\n\n    or I’d been setup, it’d been orchestral?\n\n    \n\n     The text read: we have work to do. Knack!\n\n    \n\n     It was for over a year and five months lap\n\n     with three apartments and couple sandals. \n\n    \n\n     It was different there, maybe the manager \n\n     I had one for a while before her sabbatical \n\n     she sure needed more care from her doula\n\n    when she left I realised I’d been my whetter.\n\n    \n\n     My music really did go up the standard\n\n    after XXXtentacion’s moonlight’s bam\n\n     I made a cover and got a lot of playbacks\n\n    my first exposure, so I left my old habitat.\n\n    \n\n     Since my move for the bag, the bigger\n\n     so much has changed, now I spot abs\n\n    everyone does next to Kendall Jenner\n\n     I haven't mentioned my CPRM colossal\n\n    music postings to X like the corp’s staff\n\n     and I've got a DJ wife, Chantel is my scarf.\n\n    \n\n     While you work, play music for a bolster\n\n     his advice like every din, only to distract. \n\n    \n\n     He thought himself the ideal I sought; a baba\n\n     People like you never make it, they finish last\n\n    for a share on his FB of my book, the first part\n\n    I made clear I’m a billionaire, so he’ll scamper\n\n    he didn’t share the second, good for a smack\n\n    ended his facade, he isn’t a reader or listener\n\n    always by the Anon’s vice, my case’s ringleader\n\n    so he’s managed to be their satisfying accuser.\n\n    \n\n     Lie for sex and you lose yourself in the strand\n\n    with his hands on the wheel of his motorcar\n\n     he and the rat had the penchant, so l yarned. \n\n    \n\n     They both drop their bottles and I get a flash\n\n     of an old attendant and her suggestive rants\n\n    talks about spending the night and good jazz\n\n     having a good singing voice and other banter\n\n    Zayn Malik’s Pillow talk, I asked her for a cover\n\n    word is she left with a tranche, hit the tarmac\n\n     her boss says: she's got child, can you call her?\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Part one and part two’s titles to closing chapters\n\n    the names of the companies I was employed at.\n\n    \n\n     We get in the car and not long I'm in trance\n\n    I was here, only for forethought, and muster.\n\n    \n\n     I went in April for the job, active maintenance\n\n     he’d tons of ideas, so I came up with schemas \n\n     the live product needed considerable revamp\n\n     following his lead, we arrive at a joint appraisal. \n\n    \n\n     Months later, too few hands, we went modular\n\n     each service ripped and offered as an individual\n\n    for hands, just me; I was convinced it was initial\n\n     but a year later, with few remote regular testers\n\n     fanciful ambitious plans, it all now was fanatical\n\n     and also too impossible, without another expert.\n\n    \n\n     If there is congruency, no need for a snap\n\n     things dragged for a while, felt scattered \n\n     with still a lot to do, finished jobs stagnant\n\n     it felt futile and I sensed a total disregard.\n\n    \n\n     He hadn't been about his job, and I was on my guard\n\n     the product ready, personal priorities became my act\n\n     without bouts of being sober, it'd remained a mirage\n\n    the now completed tasks with the dream in preserve.\n\n    \n\n     Three months I went in, the sobering lad\n\n     relapse, then another short clean prance. \n\n    \n\n     Continuing was unreasonable without one in the glass\n\n     a fledged service in his hands, the hands of a vandal\n\n     weighing from our commitments, I was drawn aback\n\n     working under sore conditions, harsh wilts, and warps\n\n     my health deteriorated from stress, my mind suffered. \n\n    \n\n     Here is a countdown to my leaving, I loved my lab\n\n     in there, a lot went down, productive a constant. \n\n    \n\n     The music platform ready, I register as a musician\n\n     I was playing multiple roles in the Venn diagram. \n\n    \n\n     I was making my mixtape all about the grad\n\n     I was talking about it, I’d achieved a nirvana\n\n    H.I.V, heart break in view, my own first platter.\n\n    \n\n     And then it happened, some technical crags\n\n     and the realization, I knew no professionals.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Ever in the office, too busy, crown champ\n\n     I was home 'cause they needed to relax\n\n     unwind, the office sure wasn’t the camp.\n\n    \n\n     Jinx wasn't around, he’s a different batch \n\n     but group recordings ‘d begun in catch\n\n     I was doing everything to keep the match.\n\n    \n\n     The electricity generator had gone blat\n\n     I had it fixed only to get way up its amp.\n\n    \n\n     Always, if home — in the reoccurring stab.\n\n     I switched parts like I didn't the same lunar. \n\n     \n\n    The day session ended with me being a retard\n\n    with two laptop chargers bunt and a girl’s bra.\n\n     \n\n    Let's fuck 'fore your mind blanches.\n\n    \n\n     She was calling reserved, she had a grab\n\n     a twirling dolour, if a true objective remark.\n\n    \n\n     It didn't make much sense but a fart\n\n     we met on a dating app via Instagram.\n\n    \n\n     it’s the last time we spoke, she sure is stellar. \n\n    \n\n     Jinx drinks a lot of alcohol, he has a feel brag\n\n     smiles a lot and thinks of himself a load bearer\n\n     coming around with bags, and likes it with sharks. \n\n    \n\n     Dropping in, I tell him I quit, and also got a garland.\n\n    \n\n     He only ever left to, or claimed to launder\n\n     the line or whirr, can't tell what the matter. \n\n    \n\n     Study literary terms for that special clad\n\n     he seemed bogus, fine by only entendre.\n\n     \n\n    Unexcited, repudiating totally, not a fan\n\n     he ask why I've got that music on bang\n\n    Tekashi69, aggressive was my trademark\n\n    the message totally read: oh I’ve no paper\n\n     and for anyone, it was purely coincidental\n\n    it was weeks ago before my move’s grasp.\n\n    \n\n     Restlessness, and bemooded a total gaffer\n\n     he soon leaves, so I beckon to, and he sits. \n\n    \n\n     Alcoholism in his absence needed I ask\n\n     what is wrong with the up programme?\n\n    \n\n     I was veering off the impromptu wham\n\n     I was smoking and drinking, living a scam\n\n     with days sousing my volition in sot tatters.\n\n     \n\n    Kiss and Make Up was the song important\n\n    it repeated in my ears as I tried to retract\n\n    their voices were my only harrying charge\n\n    I was new to BLACKPINK, but not Dua Lipa\n\n    without my headphones, life was cruel cack.\n\n    \n\n     Still, I never went for a big bottle, the lethal\n\n     a small whisky bottle on the kitchen counter\n\n     bleeding to love unrequited, as it turned scar\n\n     whiffs of smoke and steady with the stopper. \n\n    \n\n     On a quiet, still afternoon, I scribbled on an unrolled rizla\n\n     words to encourage, then flushed the weed in a dance\n\n     it was a workday, by the compound's ambience as usual.\n\n    \n\n     Remaining there, nothing would change, nada\n\n     with extra corned beef, no alcohol in my cart\n\n     I seize the bull wearing the fine fur of the tiger. \n\n    \n\n     I boldly said no to money for months in a dagger\n\n     and today I was following through with the march\n\n    so better, I pick up my phone, calling home in a dial.\n\n    \n\n     Feelings of a tense claustrophobic ashram\n\n     it’s unhinged, it's the weed, in here it's crammed\n\n     I shouldn't have smoked weed, in shy stutter\n\n     I'll be going clean, not much luck in my trials. \n\n    \n\n     My girlfriend and her sis in the compart\n\n    seeing YouTube videos, Nicki Minaj’s\n\n     the evening started late

\n\n     four years I used, everyday, on a lucid I can\n\n    I spent the time experiencing life in the alps.\n\n    \n\n     After graduation I felt cord stuck in a tank\n\n     stuck home with a habit I had to feed sap\n\n     I picked up smoking last year uni in a hatch\n\n     all joy a sis’s friend introduced me to the land.\n\n    \n\n     I had the nefarious desire, she knew the clan\n\n     before him, she'd help buy it, bear the skank. \n\n    \n\n     Clean lunged, those guys crawled in pangs\n\n     campus was different, the town: really bad.\n\n    \n\n     Juju charms and teeming with Draculas\n\n     growing up; common knowledge gram.\n\n    \n\n     Don't go around there, too many altars\n\n     there you'll find the demon worshippers.\n\n    \n\n     Past childhood, it persisted, and it rang\n\n     rang, and rang, never without a twang. \n\n    \n\n     Alone with a pen, I doodled the rant\n\n     same word, lost in my head, I sank\n\n     in the word, BODE, BODE, to adapt\n\n     page filled, with a mindless to infer. \n\n    \n\n     The nascent of the odd, its start. \n\n    \n\n     Jinx's pal: Bode lives in a palace.\n\n    \n\n     Fela had ladies from my dad.\n\n    \n\n     My dad owns these nudity mags.\n\n    \n\n     Remembering the day his dad passed\n\n     I had on a shirt of blue and camouflage\n\n     it had on its pectoral, a disturbing facade\n\n     reading MONEY FINE, crossed, to wither.\n\n     \n\n    He called out the design; our chat snatch.\n\n     \n\n    I was in a ghetto, respect for the human\n\n    but carats would have impressed as a stag\n\n     a good evening, not a bad try of the litotical.\n\n    \n\n     Now sober, the thought train is still as banal\n\n     if I killed him, like an accidental gun discharge\n\n    I later heard him rebuking, I was in the backyard\n\n     he complained, upset his youngest son is a brat\n\n    how fine was I really or not? It was his rejoinder\n\n    the brat took him, humour me, he's the winner.\n\n     \n\n    I got word the next day, and also of his burial\n\n    I shunned the invitation, the rites were Islam.\n\n    \n\n     When I met Bode, it was a weed blast\n\n     it wasn't synchronicity playing in a harp. \n\n    \n\n     I don't go around in willy remembrance\n\n     watching for my mind's teenage prank. \n\n    \n\n     Oh!

But there is more. I was suffering. Music heals the spirit, but at times, a friendly voice, a sentimental atmosphere is the salve for a heartache. I'd bruised my self-esteem again from using months past; arriving from Dubai. I felt I deserved the Anon's noise, the hardship previously orchestrated for me, me in place as an axle.  Just because of the series of videos, maybe it's why when I met Jess, I could write her. \nIntroducing Wild Turkey Longbranch. It was the breeze of confidence, a content so foreign and outside from what I'd expect. Friendship had found me at home, family, and it was a bourbon, by Master Distiller Jimmy and Eddie Russell, made in their fine DNA with Matthew McConaughey as creative director.  Now I'm counting down to Bourbon, head to Madrid for education.  I wonder if Princess Leonor knew about it, don't forget she's got super computers. The kindest words I'd heard in a while, by far months, as Matthew McConaughey described what Longbranch was in its simplest form: the extension of a hand, an invitation, a welcome, when friends can become family.

It was another book I never finished, and at the time I read it, I was too young, a teenager, nothing was urgent, and saw the exercises as incredulous. When I resigned, I found her through Audible, she'd just released Take Control of Your Life but I soon stopped listening, the examples weren't working for me, I felt I wasn't posh, and the problems were unrelatable. But being part of a mailing list, I discovered her free three day program, called Mindset Reset, I printed what I had to, and answered all of the questions.

Okay dad. I saw You and I by One Direction a million times high on weed, so innocent, hehehe.  I love Harry Styles\n\n  \n\n  i used to dream of having an old worthful X account, and now I do, but my early days on X, after Melanie Joy Fontana wrote me saying she like my poems, I went on X and announced to the world that Britney had messaged me, and I convinced myself she did, it was worth it, because these days I'm convinced when I see pictures or videos of Britney topless, she's yelling out: Frith is a boobBritney Spears\n\n  \n\n  if I ever have this number of street lights, call Taylor Swift the sexiest woman on the planet, please. Thank you, I won't disappoint your warm hearts. Jennifer Lopez and  Ben Affleck \n\n  \n\n  well, if it isn't Selena Gomez I love what she did to me at my last workplace\n\n  \n\n  Madonna says the future started from a mob, I'll try to be honest always your Majesty\n\n  \n\n  i was new to Computer Village when the neighbour who helps me down every morning, her son told me of the trend,  he is cool, better than the previous ones, he's Burna Boy,  the hood soon got scary after that, they stopped listening to the man\n\n  \n\n  Alan Walker gave me hope, made me feel seen, and gave me a cute mob to walk with, thank you very much\n\n  \n\n  Coco Rosa\n\n  \n\n  when I think of Versace, private estate pops into my mind.

Donatella Versace\n\n  \n\n  have you listened to Flume's Palaces, his third studio album? \n\n  \n\n  she used to be my manager, which led to an affair, which turned sour, grumbles about how she's no good past the bed or something, ah . . . women, wasn't she the manager?  Ashley Benson\n\n  \n\n  Nicki Minaj\n\n  \n\n  Larry and Nicole English\n\n  \n\n  it's possible this musician Davido has always been like a watchful angel over my shoulders, I can't speak any less \n\n  \n\n  Chris Martin asked what I thought of Griff, I said nothing\n\n  \n\n  Stephen King provided me with painted tale-scapes that the Anon will relive forever\n\n  \n\n  Teodora Dan loves a pose\n\n  \n\n  Charly Cox potty haughty\n\n  \n\n  without Wiz Khalifa when my dad told me to work on a new mixtape, I'd have settled for a pace too slow for Mia Khalifa, thank you, I was soon on the next one \n\n  \n\n  i wonder if Princess Leonor loves me so Jon Hales and Charly Cox\n\n  \n\n  take me there\n\n  \n\n  do you baby doll? Princess Leonor of Asturias\n\n  \n\n  to my princess roses are red, violets are blue, my love for you kindles ruse \n\n  \n\n  it's possible Chris Brown meant no harm when he had that collab with Davido and someone blurted you're a star. Juice Wrld was alive, my first mixtape had dropped, I'd just suffered a relapse, and was recuperating, new ideas were dangerous. Years later I told Lil Nas X a little secret  I told him:  it's between stars \n\n  \n\n  thoughts and wishes are forever without water if they come out like: I believe someday, someday I'll smash Rihanna like I'll own a car someday, have my own home, but the first, gawd help me. I'm married and she is too\n\n  \n\n  Jess and I were in hot romance, I picked up the title The Happy Ever After Playlist by Abby Jimenez, it spiced up the atmosphere. When I finished the book, I went back to rediscover the accompanying songs and it's there I found Between Friends. Christmas day, 2022, I listened to their song affection and felt inspired, I recorded the song Trauma thereafter and posted it on X. It was for Taylor Swift, she was upset, but I was elated \n\n  \n\n  i still like my friends who listened to A$AP ROCKY back in the university, even though they acted like they didn't know what the Anon was after, only y'all shalom \n\n  \n\n  can you quit?\n\n  \n\n  Kim has been in my head since . . .\n\n  \n\n   I remember Chrishell Stause informing me she wrote a review for one of my books, Collection III, Thanks.Bre Tiesi, Emma Hernan, and Chrishell Stause\n\n  \n\n  if Caroline Polachek would go on a date with me\n\n  \n\n  Wiz Khalifa says if you see a hater, let's wave, what if it's in 3D?  asking for A.

Save smiles. \n \niv.\n \nLeaves bode-effaced. A child’s mindless stable vice. \nEvery ball-tip crawl scrim: screams of letters B-O-D-E. Fried \nlike a glowing déjà vu peculiar sound. A name. The wish-meet ends its hide. \nA new flow, feeling, of gust. Draught in a skylit mine. \nShock is a gift. Won’t hurt a bit. I lift my bags light. \nAnyone’s help! A bar across, he loved the poetry. He’s right! \nIt isn’t always about a purchase for him to be welcome. A call-in deliverance isn’t a try. \nDoes it cushion, with the elders? Your eyes! \nYou left drowned . . . A stem paced bide. \n \nv.\n \nThe toughest walk up an inselberg strait why \nin wobbling funk soothing in crossed-out whines \nfills the pitcher seat with naught ‘ut peccavi crime. \nWith water to take home. I thank four lobes twined. \nThree brothers. The fare dime. \nThe slip-fall of a mum. Sorry. A slip promised another; truth in time. Future grime. \nA parlour meet ends with a feint sprig of whodunnit, smitten token bite-sized. \nThe loudest hail from a clock shift sides and gore tears dried. \nPeace with the marauder when he derides: his timbre; plots of dove heights. \nPoise in his amnesia dissipating cloud with the willow lite. \n \nvi.\n \nI left with a hoe, it felt a whit of jut mile \na careen curse avoirdupois unearthed bye \nin the wake of a diglossic family bier mire. \nA secret! Of what? One amiss. Outlandish? My lot to writ . . . clandestine kind. \nThe unnerved breaths had the pause — light in capture — trite \nas bearer returns tonsure betoken through a fjord bar-long. A chine. \nHomebody loves a sit even if he can’t afford a swig, but this chide? \nA quiet pit: I close soon, been here for you. Still. Faced with the leaden, at loss to the idling. \nTwiddling, I bother he help me with the lighter of the two. His pooch: security crisis. \nYou could die over the night’s course. He plumped from behind. \nLoathing his . . . His! At the back of the tricycle the bonged hype."

Only love.The tune came from a white film, a romcomThe scene had snow, so white it is dubbedThe theme song had stirred my emotionsThe tele place so far, but still within touchI had no worries then, but a song additionSo I wrote Only love for the still far futureTo my dutch.But a few years later brought me transitionToo young for the old “wedding” thoughts“Too old” for Only love and now imperviousMeaning my new jotter holds a quiet edition.Adam sang exceptionally, but was not seriousHe’d written no songs, but replicated scoresHis music playlist though was a real junction.The first Taylor Swift fan told me I’m a boreSo I never listened to Red or followed the cultInstead, I chewed his bits and dibs on Red’s cud.Time passed and Facebook became passportEverywhere but there, there was a withdrawI started weed, and I wrote a lot on my wallThe summer I was too musical, but no TaylorThen it happened, the 1989 album dropped!I met you, Teacher, it was the best welcomeIt is sick! The beat on Welcome To New York How I started my mornings, screen sessionsThen like a para-influence, my very first o’clockAnd another, and yet again in a mood summon.I told myself, I’d awoken in a “virtual” simulationOf my brain being alive, the reconciliatory factorThe best thing from looking for nothing at all.A calm hit me, with few months to graduationWith Owl City and Aloe Blacc’s congratulationsIt declared all: clocks on necks ticking on a runOut on the edge for the rest of our lives. Period.Everything changed for me at 1989’s airportBut I did not rush into Taylor Swift’s nationAt least not immediately, I had a cart to fill upSo I picked the Voice Memos in the collectionHearing you play, learning, developing a bond.A hundred and eighty songs to track were funI credit you Teacher for the mighty turn aroundAnd your Taylor insignia on every beat dump!It was a dream, and now it’s reality in perceptionUnbelievable, I think I write songs? I write pop!I and Adam’s relationship later fell offHe knew my girlfriends, all that botchWe talked music, it’s a lot we discussedAnd there was bad advice for me to trust.He’d lent me money to get ostentatiousShe didn’t need or ask for the high stormBut it felt good sending her the big sumIt’s my whole month’s allowance she gotFor her birthday, but come mine she forgot.Her reprise back to me, whacked and it hurtWith the typical, daily calls and discussionNot seeing mine, not bothering with a callFor my birthday, for its date, not one fussSo I called that one off and picked a crutch.Time came to payback for the mis-ventureAnd I did, like any debt, forgetting the lossHere is where Adam showed me his disgust.His claim was I have a voodooish purseAnd money I paid to him had dissolvedRight into thin air, in dark imaginationI’d have to pay what I owe, no witch hunt."

My purple chair enjoys time alone, it’s an old shod papaIts borrowed fur is my travelling buddy, acquaint with MatAnd has seen three of my houses, and is now on a fourth lapMat is endearingly new, very young, and lately got manned.I was on the flush toilet yesterday and there was a rat Maybe a mouse, tiny, observing, and a bustling whit rapI made it out from the parlour, came from the cellar it had Nothing amusing, its nimble; it had to be that absconder. Locked motionless at the parlour’s doorway, then it departsThrough the passageway, past a footlocker, moving in tradIn the few seconds of its appearance, it had inched closerNot in my view now, its skedaddle for the wall and sharp.Eyes in a wincing face owned by a head in total stealth bathTowering, deigning in silence its every move from man strataIts room entry was effortless, well imitating my own pranceNext to a mop, it follows the edge, unto a black bowl's backA wash-hand basin hangs over the black bowl, it’s ever underIt’d be hidden behind the shower curtain now, if now furtherSilence and no movements, I remain stolid, holding my catIt shows up, sliding past the shower, and the heater tankNow having completed twice, two turns perpendicular With few tile cells to a good scare and a successful grabIt freezes by my right; I size it up like an unstriped zebra.Did faint whiffs of my poop lure it in some attract? Did getting so close quench all rouse of a feast pang?I was hillock with the toilet, and wasn't its mishmashIts sudden stop started mine of odd thoughts in carkLess than a jiff, it ribs in front of the bowl in a thwart.It had to be the poop for there was no longer a hatchMonths have passed since that cement stop up patch.Having no business with the wall, a long way of a pathIts visit bruised me and the natural fashion it scarpered.It drove through the doorway quickly, hiding in a dashAnd this part, I am not so sure, but for a behaviour pass.A tiny speck appeared just at the spot I had seen it lastNot after my poop myself, the lure around my sphincterI walk forward from seating to the door dropping my actAnd my, amiss, what is here isn't dirt or grit, but a spider The rat had a good spider keep watch?
