with laundry</p>\n<p>with ten hours for the win</p>\n<p>enough time in the quilt</p>\n<p>I had dinner in between</p>\n<p>and settled in bed clean</p>\n<p>I'd like to think</p>\n<p>almost suffering a

as inconsequential and as dismissive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It’s a desk another sits and also well fits</p>\n<p>doing so whenever he does his log filling</p>\n<p>similar to the CSO’s, probably a

cunning scheme</p>\n<p>such disrespect to do that, isn't it?</p>\n<p>or it is my previous collar and its bling?</p>\n<p>he could be co-ordinator of everything</p>\n<p>I don’t like him, neither his several whims</p>\n<p>that lone desk was the crème de la crème</p>\n<p>none wrote by it, just a guy on internship</p>\n<p>I saw him once, the same day I said, I quit</p>\n<p>he also wrote by the pipes in tow briefly</p>\n<p>there were others writing too, definitely</p>\n<p>they towered over us in their high offices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He had assistant precede his initialism</p>\n<p>bleh, I never got to doing any liking</p>\n<p>or his initialism either, any remembering</p>\n<p>he was gone and he behaved differently.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In some corners, you’ll hear it's a big erring</p>\n<p>this initialism tailing his slim harangue steam</p>\n<p>all silently whispered against his apodeictic</p>\n<p>he worked for buck and didn’t care the least</p>\n<p>and well imposed on our job’s security

stirring some tiff.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That morning, I was in a whole different league</p>\n<p>I could not reconcile all of the messy cleaning</p>\n<p>I was chunking out waste, gathering the musty</p>\n<p>with a spooky broom, its bristles ineffective</p>\n<p>it is still very rattling, as well as disturbing</p>\n<p>he mentioned starting as so to suggest a win</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>How has that been, his bid?</p>\n<p>his back still into it; working? </p>\n<p>he does do some work it seems</p>\n<p>enjoying the chill as he breathes</p>\n<p>his chores include type branding</p>\n<p>after a good lunch, he’s seen loafing</p>\n<p>you’ll find him by pipes, stamping</p>\n<p>pretending to check for quality</p>\n<p>dismissing the well-known phony</p>\n<p>unmistakable funny-voiced wimp</p>\n<p>whom to his conscientious notoriety</p>\n<p>watering his sympatric ick wishy-washy</p>\n<p>sees to the quality assurance artifice</p>\n<p>swinging by moments after he leaves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It could be both of their clingings</p>\n<p>two men on an unnecessary duty</p>\n<p>quality assured with a slung grin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As to whom this helper was helping?</p>\n<p>he wanted me, I was the credible

chink.</p>\n<p>he had that certain air to him, he's neat</p>\n<p>kept his own water bottle; clue to his wit</p>\n<p>so day two I had a bottle for myself filled</p>\n<p>but was told off by a colleague of disease.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>That night, briefly unable to sleep, in drift</p>\n<p>I cleared, something is in the water, think</p>\n<p>for my wakefulness, I couldn’t tell which</p>\n<p>the water, or the screen set to my face lit</p>\n<p>I was back to my mobile, resolved to my grit</p>\n<p>my acuity was fine, but I’d lost my action’s beat</p>\n<p>the three hand-me-downs, and cell lured meaning</p>\n<p>all four on my bed, the vileness had me crestfallen.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He’d helped me with the dust clearing</p>\n<p>briefly showing me tacitly by

scooping</p>\n<p>everyone there had me play cleaner in cecity</p>\n<p>maybe it gave them a bang, some ol' good trip. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He is the engineer gone crazy</p>\n<p>so went everyone

got the deal</p>\n<p>producing no pipes till the evening's seal</p>\n<p>the last hour was of heaping and banding</p>\n<p>with my afternoon spent heavy lifting </p>\n<p>and as collateral and unproductive</p>\n<p>they mostly were rejects, scrap things</p>\n<p>that muscle-toned body? I wasn’t convinced</p>\n<p>he wasn't a new recruit, I was, and candid</p>\n<p>didn't see myself ever being of blue-chip</p>\n<p>or moving up this ladder of no paperclips</p>\n<p>the control area, its wires, patches, end slits</p>\n<p>the quagmires, his perceived wins, and spins</p>\n<p>had me so overwhelmed, could it all be fiddling?</p>\n<p>then I saw the inducting manual on the machine</p>\n<p>and in that moment, hope was restored, ching!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Dressed in an attire that's native</p>\n<p>the ubiquitous patterned print</p>\n<p>he doesn't hide in his sleeve</p>\n<p>his obvious tribal favouritism</p>\n<p>chroming his brother's lid</p>\n<p>forgetting the obvious lackey</p>\n<p>none other than yours truly</p>\n<p>it just was sad, a fair admitting</p>\n<p>I’d say no quibbles, no taunting</p>\n<p>no glibness from my end or gibs </p>\n<p>pun intended, no crippling stilt</p>\n<p>he wished he was the rich chief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yes I left the village too, who is this?</p>\n<p>here is the countenance of his discipline</p>\n<p>how many chiefs to get that instilled?</p>\n<p>he had the boorish unlikely skin</p>\n<p>his shaved hair showed his maudlin</p>\n<p>I am corralling glibness?

school, for I’d left earlier for the known gaol</p>\n<p>on arrival, we both went thrifting, and it went well with no complaint</p>\n<p>on returning, my new girlfriend welcomed me in slush rush fellate</p>\n<p>he’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace</p>\n<p>I’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image</p>\n<p>we loved a band, so she rammed their names at me, time and again</p>\n<p>I enjoyed One Direction’s music, so it helped me to consolidate</p>\n<p>when his girl arrived, we headed out with his dad’s car in carnage</p>\n<p>the venue bustled, but he convinced clubbing ends the mundane</p>\n<p>by midnight we could go in, then we would enjoy the sound buffet</p>\n<p>he’d left for the barbecue, leaving his girl, who’s somewhat soignée</p>\n<p>I looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved</p>\n<p>with beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate</p>\n<p>enjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first time, I could be frail</p>\n<p>a few inches away, his girl struck chords for one to contemplate</p>\n<p>she was beautiful, and made the night slow, then an accelerate</p>\n<p>armed men appeared, I was editing pictures, admiring my urbane</p>\n<p>for we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display</p>\n<p>confronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase</p>\n<p>outside the venue, he shoved me into his car, I felt like a renegade</p>\n<p>I was shaken, a nightmare—it is not my favourite night to recreate</p>\n<p>he said nothing, we’d been away for minutes, the silence was grave</p>\n<p>returning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain</p>\n<p>across the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged</p>\n<p>a while later he left back for the hotel across, he’d to plant a grenade</p>\n<p>I was sure he had one, for the fright stage was a real soul freight</p>\n<p>scared in the car alone, clueless in the new silence, I try an escape</p>\n<p>furtive, I opened the door, and got out of sight as if to quickly email</p>\n<p>this side of the road was lonely, so I went across for the said mail</p>\n<p>I hid behind cars by the hotel’s entrance, on their exit, I’d be veiled</p>\n<p>on the other lane, his car stood alone and it sure wasn’t a shay</p>\n<p>I wasn’t getting married, for the groom had left his bride astray</p>\n<p>some more shots went off and he darted out as someone caned</p>\n<p>speeding off with the other police men in a mind calming rampage.</p>\n<img  alt=\"Image\" class=\"img-fluid lazy

drained</p>\n<p>I got my phone back hours later; the reason of arrest wasn’t plain</p>\n<p>no official reason was given, none was convincing, or hit the nail</p>\n<p>a dude took me home that night, he said Pimple roused that bane </p>\n<p>he was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey</p>\n<p>he added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate</p>\n<p>all night he smoked pot, with his house on a course to dilapidate</p>\n<p>he complained about his old mother, it was our convo’s punctuate</p>\n<p>she, his doom in life, he believed he wasn’t birthed, but arraigned</p>\n<p>his whining dragged for a while, and I refused his indignance plate</p>\n<p>as I was sleepy, I did get to sleep, but not without his rant’s delay</p>\n<p>when the day broke, he led me to Pimple’s house like an associate</p>\n<p>he’d claimed he knew Pimple, as if his identity wasn’t at all private</p>\n<p>not convinced, but for their proximately close residential estates</p>\n<p>he said little on our way, having been turgid, maybe not to conflate</p>\n<p>by Pimple’s house gate, I saw his patient waiting as if to acculturate</p>\n<p>he’d done enough, he’d been nice, but going on was to constipate</p>\n<p>I got received and he said bye, I was glad my opinions didn’t remain</p>\n<p>my parents arrived, he said, he hadn’t expected the events’ chain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I knew university could be anything as I could variate</p>\n<p>so I often made money on the side without any refrain</p>\n<p>making beats, audio mixing, it provided me with a cape</p>\n<p>at times resetting stolen or bad devices, I never feigned</p>\n<p>opposite my room, drugs got labelled and repackaged</p>\n<p>being a famous pot head, whom nothing did infatuate</p>\n<p>you’d find me in my room, screen facing past average</p>\n<p>a good number were convinced I’d found my own way</p>\n<p>come graduation, they saw a repairman in the range</p>\n<p>a marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes</p>\n<p>convinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate</p>\n<p>an unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate</p>\n<p>but I was making clean dough with no girl to debate</p>\n<p>Kendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate</p>\n<p>mull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate</p>\n<p>songs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>By third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate</p>\n<p>I’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay</p>\n<p>in a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray</p>\n<p>for I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay</p>\n<p>in stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained</p>\n<p>I wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language</p>\n<p>on weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane</p>\n<p>I wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate</p>\n<p>when finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade</p>\n<p>I’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate</p>\n<p>so in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed</p>\n<p>where repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate</p>\n<p>for new devices needed some of our service coverage</p>\n<p>with the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged</p>\n<p>the store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe</p>\n<p>you could walk through the three using some pathway</p>\n<p>it connected all three offices through inner doorways</p>\n<p>his office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage</p>\n<p>with the store leading outside to the numerous signage</p>\n<p>two ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake</p>\n<p>in house repairmen with records equalling certificates</p>\n<p>we’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday</p>\n<p>Hennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace</p>\n<p>I met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate</p>\n<p>I dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate</p>\n<p>and so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create</p>\n<p>a more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait</p>\n<p>I hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate</p>\n<p>but no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain</p>\n<p>so we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village</p>\n<p>it’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale</p>\n<p>just a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate</p>\n<p>I was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail</p>\n<p>the little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates</p>\n<p>this was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage</p>\n<p>it was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage</p>\n<p>for she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes</p>\n<p>he led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase</p>\n<p>taking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain</p>\n<p>I continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled</p>\n<p>pulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign</p>\n<p>but a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade</p>\n<p>here is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale</p>\n<p>CV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape</p>\n<p>had a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste</p>\n<p>it was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned</p>\n<p>that afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate</p>\n<p>we were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate</p>\n<p>the price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate</p>\n<p>clearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate</p>\n<p>we ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate</p>\n<p>ending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate</p>\n<p>familiarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave</p>\n<p>as he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled</p>\n<p>we’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage</p>\n<p>showing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved </p>\n<p>for its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate</p>\n<p>no phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail</p>\n<p>oh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate</p>\n<p>I headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate</p>\n<p>withdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein</p>\n<p>we all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate</p>\n<p>he’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait</p>\n<p>right under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed</p>\n<p>I was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane</p>\n<p>so I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates</p>\n<p>I wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate</p>\n<p>but few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate</p>\n<p>cornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate</p>\n<p>it left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate</p>\n<p>my fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate</p>\n<p>there were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate</p>\n<p>narrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate</p>\n<p>if we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace</p>\n<p>we soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate</p>\n<p>the environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate</p>\n<p>he motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain</p>\n<p>the lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace</p>\n<p>assenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway</p>\n<p>it led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate</p>\n<p>back outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace</p>\n<p>his arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate</p>\n<p>a ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate</p>\n<p>we headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate</p>\n<p>we both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate</p>\n<p>an in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A</p>\n<p>he’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate</p>\n<p>we went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray</p>\n<p>at a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate</p>\n<p>slothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed</p>\n<p>with a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed</p>\n<p>also uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake</p>\n<p>to me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate</p>\n<p>he was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate</p>\n<p>the question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase</p>\n<p>in deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate</p>\n<p>and I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane</p>\n<p>ever true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail</p>\n<p>so also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake</p>\n<p>it meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced</p>\n<p>no village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained</p>\n<p>in my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate</p>\n<p>with Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes</p>\n<p>with the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date</p>\n<p>every song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate</p>\n<p>the close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet</p>\n<p>and in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate</p>\n<p>my final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey!</p>\n<p>not quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate</p>\n<p>it’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins</p>\n<p>averting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay</p>\n<p>this stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate</p>\n<p>for it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine</p>\n<p>a reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde</p>\n<p>I fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Final year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage</p>\n<p>I made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade</p>\n<p>I remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage</p>\n<p>I had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate</p>\n<p>the fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate</p>\n<p>but I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape</p>\n<p>my studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail</p>\n<p>but the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged</p>\n<p>on the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade</p>\n<p>their plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate</p>\n<p>for an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade</p>\n<p>for my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale</p>\n<p>a well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane</p>\n<p>maybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace</p>\n<p>a particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint</p>\n<p>I met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray</p>\n<p>as always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate</p>\n<p>his speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate</p>\n<p>showing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage </p>\n<p>his records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained</p>\n<p>simple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain </p>\n<p>his scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database</p>\n<p>I’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate</p>\n<p>he’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake</p>\n<p>he answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate</p>\n<p>I’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed</p>\n<p>it brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main</p>\n<p>thanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The English lecturer I bet did exactly the same</p>\n<p>she made it look like a come of age soul stain</p>\n<p>the music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate</p>\n<p>I am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain</p>\n<p>a charge my current effort has debased</p>\n<p>what they thought did, never had me fazed</p>\n<p>not until trauma hit and I responded in slate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both first and final year had glops of unneeded strain</p>\n<p>as a fresher because I expected a porous membrane</p>\n<p>finals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed </p>\n<p>at no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim</p>\n<p>I was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain</p>\n<p>when the final days came of documenting and bye waves</p>\n<p>mine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste</p>\n<p>I was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail</p>\n<p>it got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes</p>\n<p>I got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté</p>\n<p>stripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate </p>\n<p>reading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage</p>\n<p>a friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the first semester ended, we created some straits</p>\n<p>by we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate</p>\n<p>maybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane</p>\n<p>as a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate</p>\n<p>no more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate</p>\n<p>I read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange</p>\n<p>and I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage</p>\n<p>and here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake</p>\n<p>pay some money to get graded only distinctions straight</p>\n<p>it was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date</p>\n<p>it was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay</p>\n<p>my first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate</p>\n<p>but our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay</p>\n<p>and plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate</p>\n<p>making the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade</p>\n<p>but my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged</p>\n<p>talks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage</p>\n<p>so the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames</p>\n<p>our worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate</p>\n<p>no one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate</p>\n<p>in our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate</p>\n<p>hell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay</p>\n<p>he suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid</p>\n<p>of everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint</p>\n<p>I believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves</p>\n<p>round the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates</p>\n<p>but for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains</p>\n<p>left me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage</p>\n<p>it would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate</p>\n<p>I just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave</p>\n<p>younger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase</p>\n<p>it was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Looking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage</p>\n<p>Code Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage</p>\n<p>reimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate</p>\n<p>a prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage</p>\n<p>he made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail</p>\n<p>my first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage</p>\n<p>it was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade</p>\n<p>he, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage</p>\n<p>and so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage</p>\n<p>the bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake</p>\n<p>one year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate</p>\n<p>another roommate detested him, everything for his sake</p>\n<p>he perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake</p>\n<p>the polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed</p>\n<p>everyone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet</p>\n<p>he gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid</p>\n<p>it’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze</p>\n<p>he’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade</p>\n<p>a love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became</p>\n<p>she hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane</p>\n<p>until he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate</p>\n<p>for they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage</p>\n<p>a Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake</p>\n<p>with the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate</p>\n<p>he then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake</p>\n<p>I wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message</p>\n<p>Baboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage</p>\n<p>you’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday?</p>\n<p>he thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate</p>\n<p>ladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale</p>\n<p>I should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate</p>\n<p>an eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage</p>\n<p>teachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate</p>\n<p>then I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate</p>\n<p>flaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate</p>\n<p>to be stuck in the mirror phase,

come, sing lullabies as he’d, so regaled</p>\n<p>wasn't on my acrid blacklist, the fella could pass for gay</p>\n<p>a seemingly gay man won't steal, not a buddy, do they?</p>\n<p>but when the

opposite room for security detail</p>\n<p>ten years older, counting, ATM his sound grate</p>\n<p>I needed someone older and with arms to excoriate</p>\n<p>I assumed he’d gotten the name as a local magnate</p>\n<p>adding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay</p>\n<p>or a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid</p>\n<p>he’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays</p>\n<p>of wasted years at other universities and of that pain</p>\n<p>lethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage</p>\n<p>I felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate</p>\n<p>he helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates</p>\n<p>seamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake</p>\n<p>it felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male</p>\n<p>nothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days</p>\n<p>summer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh?</p>\n<p>you could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe?</p>\n<p>he had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate</p>\n<p>she was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley</p>\n<p>also his name—an initialism—leaned towards the profane</p>\n<p>as a pothead years later, he showed his nay and distaste</p>\n<p>so we’d a fall out, I wasn’t a bad kid, a sort of young mage</p>\n<p>out alone at night, watching the stars twinkling softly back</p>\n<p>it was just recently I got word from the world of the literate</p>\n<p>a book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate</p>\n<p>it described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage</p>\n<p>it was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>His room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state</p>\n<p>his roomie, a real life giant on his own thought train </p>\n<p>with love for making beats, and a basketball inmate</p>\n<p>was wishful, loved his mum and deplored eating steak</p>\n<p>I hardly knew the guy, when around quite the loud bait </p>\n<p>I never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed</p>\n<p>and when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate</p>\n<p>but before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary tale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It was a day like every other, I was out by my fate</p>\n<p>with matters to attend to, for a whole day of trade</p>\n<p>ID cards were being issued; I’d the day to dedicate</p>\n<p>for weeks, I let the rush pass, as the famed reprobate</p>\n<p>only I call myself lackadaisical, bearing my martingale</p>\n<p>weighing importance tactically, it’s the way to graduate</p>\n<p>a Christian university and it’s high morals they proclaim.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I’d mine now and lunchtime came hitting me with a mace</p>\n<p>I headed for the canteen carried in hunger’s plumage</p>\n<p>a few minutes from the admin building sits its terrace</p>\n<p>I’d pass by the computer lab and colleges for a flambé</p>\n<p>but no flambé though, it was about to be a robinsonade</p>\n<p>Fanu would need a statement, it’d entail how to forsake</p>\n<p>for he was about to hand me casted fetters of bondage</p>\n<p>his bank balance was about to reveal his true portrait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Using WiFi in the foyer before the stairs, the interface</p>\n<p>our eyes met, he’d just arrived, that didn’t need an essay</p>\n<p>he was looking himself, formal, smart, and as appropriate</p>\n<p>the semesters had toned mine down, leaving me desiccate</p>\n<p>if I was female, against the rules I’d still dress up a bit risqué</p>\n<p>he’d shocked me a semester ago with what he purveyed</p>\n<p>behind me, he’d made available to a colleague my suitcase</p>\n<p>the fat dude with me the day I got swindled, it’s depraved</p>\n<p>for he knew I owned the bag, my bad I flunked the presage</p>\n<p>I retched out my plans to him in a reflection dispassionate</p>\n<p>he’d told me he’d need to run a quick errand to my dismay</p>\n<p>I said I was peckish, and if by his minutes, and to numerate</p>\n<p>five should be five, no returning to telling me stories ornate</p>\n<p>he assured me leaving no later wouldn’t be at all an abdicate</p>\n<p>nonetheless he would return on time, in an averring grimace</p>\n<p>I told him I’d leave if I’d to, but he reassured me in a palpate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alone as the silence watched uncertain of its own pervade</p>\n<p>a familiar face walked past and there was a normal exchange</p>\n<p>five minutes turned to six with no sign of him, no coruscate</p>\n<p>I looked through the windows, employing the nearby dais</p>\n<p>but no one was coming, my terms hadn’t been inchoate</p>\n<p>leaving it even with his word to, would leave me to blame</p>\n<p>it left me pensive, stuck unlike the Bible’s waiting maids</p>\n<p>I had no bag so I couldn’t leave with it, I felt like a glaik</p>\n<p>I walked away, no flinch, conscience clear by my undertake.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hours later he caught me in an ambush, where he waylaid</p>\n<p>he’d accusing questions, and no care at all to disambiguate</p>\n<p>these things never feel real, I thought in my slow repudiate       </p>\n<p>I told him I wasn’t in the room with it, as if in expected cliché</p>\n<p>I left as per our agreement, I cleared, convinced it’d exculpate</p>\n<p>tagging me in a theft report? I’d add, of the type haemorrhage</p>\n<p>he’d eyewitnesses accounts of my leaving with an appendage</p>\n<p>and of seeing it in our room, he closed swiftly to accentuate</p>\n<p>in a calming disbelief I snap at him in an assertive remonstrate</p>\n<p>he’d gone too far; his accounts were wrong and also glacé</p>\n<p>he’d alibis, I’d none, but I couldn’t afford the verbal tentage</p>\n<p>he’d set me against an open block for anyone to castigate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At the bench with every reason for his testimony to fluctuate </p>\n<p>things took a decisive turn, as he left things out to abnegate</p>\n<p>there’d been no alibis, which for me was a winning ameliorate</p>\n<p>when I called his attention, he slunk on in a baffling prevaricate</p>\n<p>the house rule was not to interrupt, not to bring on a blockage</p>\n<p>my account to the Control officers had earned me some brace</p>\n<p>at no time ‘d I been an offender, and his accusation ‘d no base</p>\n<p>Famu’s demeanour betrayed him in his continuous infiltrate</p>\n<p>as my honed confidence hinted at my own innocence saturate</p>\n<p>the Control officers seemed to address him to subtly abominate</p>\n<p>as if to say his accusations had left even him too consternate</p>\n<p>the case was soon dismissed after all due thorough expurgate</p>\n<p>in our hall of residence, everyone had questions on the outré</p>\n<p>he probably needed some quick cash was the loud corroborate</p>\n<p>some of his colleagues and hall staffs visited me to commiserate</p>\n<p>a suspension in the second year would pass for a clear deracinate</p>\n<p>the larceny investigation came to an end, soothing all of my aches</p>\n<p>in my room, the coming hours would help me unwind, to resuscitate</p>\n<p>I could be betrayed again, a new thing I’d need to legislate against</p>\n<p>I thought it’d be great to enjoy a drink, even if alone, a merry wassail</p>\n<p>just me, myself, and I enjoying one bashfully to lead in the exonerate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My moat hadn’t been crossed; I was the aporetic trifoliate</p>\n<p>what happened next had everyone on a sleuthhound's tail</p>\n<p>Fanu had run away, he had taken to his heels on mandate.</p>"

far to the west</p>\n<p>not of being late, but for the plain stealth</p>\n<p>for a lightweight in his workaday habiliment</p>\n<p>with no extra tog, a new odd, I was bagless</p>\n<p>it being the

my conscience on its tread</p>\n<p>as I knew I’d make money, hit it, and net</p>\n<p>no longer with the PC in need of repair</p>\n<p>the owner ‘d come for it, ringing my bell</p>\n<p>but I got my first manuscript submitted</p>\n<p>also a twenty-five track tape recorded</p>\n<p>also a number of epistles got funnelled</p>\n<p>with keyboard glitches the bottleneck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I felt my

that high, it’d be tainting uncouthness</p>\n<p>looking without at myself, I’d cry that I was led</p>\n<p>by some unclean spirit of an unyielding length.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Off the phone call, he asks that I sit elsewhere</p>\n<p>right across the factory gate on a tyre erected</p>\n<p>a dude was sat there all the while, as I’d waited</p>\n<p>walking down I pondered what he’d suggested </p>\n<p>as
