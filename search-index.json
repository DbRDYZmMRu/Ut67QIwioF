and Bleeding heart got the snubs I’d chosen an old video on his channel to shroud I wanted him involved, but broke, and a shy amateur so meeting Jess meant I’d won at some competition for her, my first poems were written, too enthralled it’s all because of the internet I'm here, I’m the boy and so for years, I was a muse in her content box the only lady sex out in the open is so desirous we are teammates, even when I’m playing a scuzz then supermodels, the Jenners, sweet Kendall Kendall convinced me of the true reconciliation Kylie, the Kardashians, North, I know them all Paria Hilton, but not from a book on pop culture before the pilot of her marriage series, Paris in Love employed, and somehow enrolled into an institution love had found me, saving me in the Hilton’s disrupt.   DJ Chantel Jeffries in a Tesla looking posh an Instagram story on arriving at her destination Paris’s shower, they seemed to be so numerous not a single Instagram story of hers did I ignore CJ took me to my sister, told me I’d count bucks I remember the black and white tiles in rhombus but I had not a scintilla idea whose home it was prior to being acquainted with Jess, just before Charli XCX  had zoomed Paris for her album I picked up sliving, it was How I’m feeling Now I discovered her in 2019, on the one eponymous in Dubai, on a trip that should ‘ve been a vacation the trip ended with me needing resuscitation achieved when I saw her cameltoe in transition the cart tart’s leg spread was a pleasant shock I’d refused meals, so she served the gorgeous and 2020 came, year of Covid-19 and dark humour it marked my meeting Paris Hilton in the memorious she is who to know, as Paris held on to her pup she’s got so many pets, maybe it’s Diamond it marked in recency as my first introduction I always knew her, a feeling from old songs I remember her teasing meme, son, son, son of Richard and Kathy Hilton’s adoption parties before the wedding, the bachelor Carter Reum, the pleasant yells, and calls Barron, Nicky, Conrad in a wedding picture dad sending chills in skin glow that’s envious one also giving an old memory of mine, vision as if to ease out with my natural dad’s friction for one morning, as if just done with lubrication he was in our apartment in severe grease odour my natural parents have a lasting sung discord so she moved into the other room on my relocation he’d come for her, I’m not sure what he’d to inform I was suffering a relapse and thought of the worst he was a mechanic just arriving from his workshop? for he’d slept out and a retired officer in customs. It is one of the times he has teased my depressions there is a favourite, it helped my relapse intention it’s a picture of him in a blue cardigan with nap fuzz a black pant, belt in place, waist strap in a slump it reminded me of the old sad days of distortion an event from 2018 back when I was handcuffed fed up, I had discussed about my resignation I’d to get clean from weed use, and a new drug crack-cocaine had thrown me into compulsion the wrong crowd ‘d led to my call for termination I’d a drug problem, and knew I needed a solution few weeks later in my studio apartment, still hurt in rue, I took weary pictures with joints in the mug I was by the window, topless, with eyes bloodshot and like my dad, I’d on a slim belt, but colour brown a friend had taken back a belt gift, as if to deplore on knowledge of solemnity; my new leaf resolution he Jinx was ruthless on a new air of demeanour an inexpensive belt, it’d take more to get drunk in oversized jeans, the picture still is an eyesore but my dad has helped me forge ahead, beyond there wasn’t hope, only desertion in the capture. For me it was the worst picture in the world so I tucked it in the cloud off the Samsung I remember years later receiving a notification now drug free, having very raw mixed emotions I had been away from the device for too long the memories hit me to a new lonely position for dad was new, but ’d made me house shop all in my names, there’d be no date of return.   Come seventeen months later, I am floored by a princess few months from being an adult Leonor, Princess of Asturias hit my apricot  her sis, Infanta Sofia of Spain is the bomb one day I could become king of their kingdom as if in a fairy tale, everything would blossom I’ll need to make it to Spain first past her chum but I’ve opted for being just friends in suture for the meantime, mum wanted this book done after spending a year plus in deep hibernation what you read now is its journey to completion it’s when I’d be allowed to move into my own turf uptown real estate, the gifts my parents bought a new business address, an office with elevator and my residence, a penthouse, it’s my mansion so mum’s got me connected in relevant sectors and dad has my word to be in Europe on tour maybe with both princesses I’ll get some jaunts after my business commitments, we could jaywalk I’d be well into my textbooks then and studious just as I’ve committed to dad, focused and bluff my English should help my Spanish transport.     So I believe in relationship accord having only recently been foxed my bottled thoughts sought shore in tow was an umbrage floe to thaw as criminals are not in extinction who is a stranger? I mulled anyone who’d change in a spurt a colleague who’d pull fraud? then I never knew them for sure how can I tell the tactics to employ? from my shortcomings, my dereliction it’s the pet peeve, maim to my purse it would have served me for months but I was gullible and lost composure in hindsight, it’s quite incredulous how the couple fed my perceptions subtle lies that roused my conviction a pregnancy claim lost on inspection convincing of recency, hence no bump it’s few weeks old,  and it was enough we met working for an organisation the branch was of goods distribution he was the more skilled at the labour and I got fired due to his misconduct it’s been the irony of my compunction for he held back my wages and dodged and brought up atrocious suggestions as pushing for loan, a clear insurrection with the manager upset in consternation he ‘d us exit before the day’s resumption the morning broke in brusque dismissions he provided fare and news of expulsion.   I left with everything I had brought and we maintained a good rapport we previously worked in manufacture then left the hood for the troughs but of different times, our report the outlet job was the real comfort so we all returned in the same bus he’d a place close they could squat my secondary school was few blocks a job agent, she’d been his previous his friend lived some scores seconds from my house, he seemed ever around so it was natural, to my consideration I’d some old items to sell at low costs two 4G mobile routers with no faults they both were in perfect conditions I’d use the pay for data subscriptions it would stifle fears of disconnection I had work with Diplo, some chores as well as a new demo tape’s revision.   He offered a hand in elation as he’d earn on its conclusion he’d need a phone to support to call people who could procure asking for mine for my demotion springing up an idea in a new form a phone to raise the sum’s account so he left with another for the buzz that’s two modems and phones lost he got bullied, beating, and robbed wife by side, and my items to oblivion he walked into his story’s direction.   With the dark canopy, I felt a throb from my mistakes and bad intuition he bore no pains, cuts or body sores only a sharp news, and very abrupt he’d travelled further for the meet up with reasons to be conscientious but unfortunately, he was met by goons his wife plaited his hair as I implored as other lovers warmed into discussions the night canopy got some illumination as if suddenly translucent from inversion I knew I had to leave, I had lost course his last lines were the worst of any actor.   It’s behind, my mind settling dust I'm not the only one with a loss I thought on, in calming brush  ambling in originally scruffy crocs I’d slipped in them with no remorse I was optimistic about my narration being myopic, he fulfilled his rush leaving me stranded and misinformed.   Just when I bemoaned taut the cars parked in the lot awed by their odd file sort so much room, it is Thurs! I get a ticker-smack in sight of a neighbour  in closer toggery to mine; mine, a total wall what I’d parade in, if I could hit the store green striped vest, black banded shorts it transfixed me unto a shame soapbox.   I’d never seen him on a morning run or walk, any luxury afforded in stall since living and working from my sump my current room, year count on four I’m still here, but pretentiously poor I am without an access to any funds access would mean a final full stop Bury me in 1965 poetry outpour.   That wasn’t always the padlock finishing this book for a windfall cleaning my act up for the new job I had challenges of my impression it left me a student in a sable pod metricizing the right and the wrong in the face of my career and focus.   Perspiring bitty from his pores well spiffy, and skin dewy flush with none of his sobriquet fawn or accustomed air, puppy talk nor his gung-ho, compère fog he reminds in a ghost spawned of the wipe in an intone sprawl then after a long pause . . . with his face put off he looks away in a face shove seeping the damp from my cloths continuing his way, fumbling tall for the pedestrial lot gate in strut.   In my head, on my skin, I felt an old smut the wipe, the intentional wipe, in murmur not at first! I quipped back, seeking another retort now by my house’s entrance, in reflection I go in pushing the gate very impassioned.   I’d it for some months, and free from maul with growing spite from my biological mum I'll talk later on this, belch on a bit more.   With poetry to type for a manuscript shot I’d just concluded the first Frith collection short of a battery pack, a reliable keyboard a working operating system safe from cruft a screen not responsible for all of the blush I went for it regardless of any other pitfalls eyes peeled on the power cord and fraught I was lucky to have it, I’d felt long, very stuck.   It was not really a wipe, if bringing in fuss as it came from an accidental reset prompt one I jolted at, as if without comprehension two reset prompts, and the latter with funk when I really did run the genuine file dump the second time, intentional, by my mores it was hard saying sorry, being good sport.",

not any time in the proper, I think this being hold the status quo supervisor of the factory I only spoke to him over  a couple of beefs.   Oh, maybe the table isn't his? it’s obvious than a cunning scheme such disrespect to do that, isn't it? or it is my previous collar and its bling? he could be co-ordinator of everything I don’t like him, neither his several whims that lone desk was the crème de la crème none wrote by it, just a guy on internship I saw him once, the same day I said, I quit he also wrote by the pipes in tow briefly there were others writing too, definitely they towered over us in their high offices.   He had assistant precede his initialism bleh, I never got to doing any liking or his initialism either, any remembering he was gone and he behaved differently.   In some corners, you’ll hear it's a big erring this initialism tailing his slim harangue steam all silently whispered against his apodeictic he worked for buck and didn’t care the least and well imposed on our job’s security peace.   Who then really is this man in bearing? he comes and goes, but never in a hurry and for one isn't in the least, god-fearing like the visitor from the chokehold authorities  the government's big boss who came inspecting.   Big boss's perfume had a certain ilk the pungency of a devotee’s fetish  maybe it isn't, could be my attributing but I recognize the smell as a bait’s grip an item in my natural parents’ retreat in panics following their nine-one-one call response heed.   Well at first, I was in good cheer by the greetings Monday morning saw him with an orientation checklist we’d the employment, the company’s recruited new three informing on their affairs, dos, don’ts, air, will and the grim he went on about us working to the top, and the wind chill I was starting helper, he declared, later stirring some tiff.   That morning, I was in a whole different league I could not reconcile all of the messy cleaning I was chunking out waste, gathering the musty with a spooky broom, its bristles ineffective it is still very rattling, as well as disturbing he mentioned starting as so to suggest a win   How has that been, his bid? his back still into it; working?  he does do some work it seems enjoying the chill as he breathes his chores include type branding after a good lunch, he’s seen loafing you’ll find him by pipes, stamping pretending to check for quality dismissing the well-known phony unmistakable funny-voiced wimp whom to his conscientious notoriety watering his sympatric ick wishy-washy sees to the quality assurance artifice swinging by moments after he leaves.   It could be both of their clingings two men on an unnecessary duty quality assured with a slung grin.   As to whom this helper was helping? he wanted me, I was the credible shim I loved him for his boots as brute steel his tribal tongue’s effect on English I usually would walk past in teeming zeal expect a crotch raise puff a cranky chink. he had that certain air to him, he's neat kept his own water bottle; clue to his wit so day two I had a bottle for myself filled but was told off by a colleague of disease.   That night, briefly unable to sleep, in drift I cleared, something is in the water, think for my wakefulness, I couldn’t tell which the water, or the screen set to my face lit I was back to my mobile, resolved to my grit my acuity was fine, but I’d lost my action’s beat the three hand-me-downs, and cell lured meaning all four on my bed, the vileness had me crestfallen.         He’d helped me with the dust clearing briefly showing me tacitly by doing the first morning saw me close to my kneels as the instructions swayed in quiet brandishing I was very gullible, and a pushover on resuming I barely spoke to anyone, not simple questioning there were female cleaners, those crocky cheats whom I saw, despising, on the second day finally with backs bent, facing waste water, scooping everyone there had me play cleaner in cecity maybe it gave them a bang, some ol' good trip.    He is the engineer gone crazy so went everyone bandying he is cute but I think very clumsy I am too, when plugged in, with an earpiece and there is a pretty girl, a sweet tootsie.   We barely on my first day got the deal producing no pipes till the evening's seal the last hour was of heaping and banding with my afternoon spent heavy lifting  and as collateral and unproductive they mostly were rejects, scrap things that muscle-toned body? I wasn’t convinced he wasn't a new recruit, I was, and candid didn't see myself ever being of blue-chip or moving up this ladder of no paperclips the control area, its wires, patches, end slits the quagmires, his perceived wins, and spins had me so overwhelmed, could it all be fiddling? then I saw the inducting manual on the machine and in that moment, hope was restored, ching!         Dressed in an attire that's native the ubiquitous patterned print he doesn't hide in his sleeve his obvious tribal favouritism chroming his brother's lid forgetting the obvious lackey none other than yours truly it just was sad, a fair admitting I’d say no quibbles, no taunting no glibness from my end or gibs  pun intended, no crippling stilt he wished he was the rich chief.   Yes I left the village too, who is this? here is the countenance of his discipline how many chiefs to get that instilled? he had the boorish unlikely skin his shaved hair showed his maudlin I am corralling glibness? well probably I didn't like him, it is my fervent scream he held no power, speaking searingly.    I had gotten my phone, I'll save the story I came home to it, the tale bears nothing someone is hoping I’m still that little kid storks visit parents with new-born babies.   On the third day, things went implosive engineer gone crazy was with a weenie they spoke casually, posturing too silly by the generators, they stood chattery both engineers I bet have no degrees.   Doing the usual—lifting and heaving since we weren’t doing any producing I got sent around a lot in close tugging I helped unload a truck with the codgerly he told me of his woes; how the job stinks and I wondered, arms puffed, how he grew too old now to complain of fortune or will?   So I quit on the third day after a meal I had gotten some sou fiat sheets surprised at how relatively expensive how I couldn't buy noodles for a tit I had some peanuts and biscuits and came home with the change gleaming because I had struck on a new opportunity but it didn’t appear out of the air thin.   I was telling Mr initialism I quit and betraying his favourite's heads up were: not suddenly wait till the end of the day, I’ll add a good tip he promised to help me with my pay receiving while he helped me at my job for no reason he was actually doing his job; I was there merely not just him, another dude on bammy sleeping pill couldn’t tell what, but the favourite poured a drink out of a sachet, no label, the pellucid kind, I quill.    Wait till the end of the day, he hissed that was morning, it was lunch, my toodle pip impromptu, I showed up with a filled belly and guess who I was meeting?   Mr initialism told me I could leave, please if only for once I could save my euphemisms no remorse, I wasn't a model, I had ditched whom the favourite had in mind when he promised? I couldn’t tell, it isn't clear, besides he was hinged.    Bye, we are not paying I was told by the CSO it goes daily remember, no paper works, sweet loopholing it was good sinking dialogue in my mind's sink.    the manager had said they’d be doing accounting not that week though, it’d be the upcoming week we’d create bank accounts to be added to the list information changes, it’s about who you’re asking.   The favourite had traits of my natural dad, feels I didn't tell him, but it could have been a tale hill trust me, I wish I had more time for the peeping all of my findings would have left me quite happy.   In retrospect, for reporting it was nothing but a round of the classic he was a new arrival who’d found his party and he at once got to do it already sleeping in the compound, no one sees it all just bores me, this drawing reporting to anyone his inept skills.   Mr initialism, I prefer chintz I don't quite remember you charming.    All through I posed with my limbs throwing off a ready for work shrill maybe it was too loud—too overkill.   The third guy, lending like a side chick same tribe as me, a we? if he could just be my Jill he’d be my favourite we would end guy two in a twig.   Considerably . . . same age, but he spoke with an ill if, and few times I thought him speaking.    Like a frail well done, in all that blaring moving on, showing no wrenching well balanced, hand clenching . . . the biggest pipe in casting a pipe I never got to lift the pipe’s size was mayhem's shadow pit come meet the glorious beast the prize for all your toiling.   disturbing was that the thought of the feat until my introduction at the outlet-reach it wasn't bad, get a balance, grip it between openly at the factory, I played body building throw it at me, I am in custodianship.   Days later at the outlet, for a colleague  I well could have been seen as a chicken counting the days he played supreme by keeping the skill of need it was barely a one minute teach.   Now tell me about the real the wonders of improvising.    As a close the favourite can't write or bleat.",

fellate</p>\n<p>he’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace</p>\n<p>I’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image</p>\n<p>we loved a band, so she rammed their names at me, time and again</p>\n<p>I enjoyed One Direction’s music, so it helped me to consolidate</p>\n<p>when his girl arrived, we headed out with his dad’s car in carnage</p>\n<p>the venue bustled, but he convinced clubbing ends the mundane</p>\n<p>by midnight we could go in, then we would enjoy the sound buffet</p>\n<p>he’d left for the barbecue, leaving his girl, who’s somewhat soignée</p>\n<p>I looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved</p>\n<p>with beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate</p>\n<p>enjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first time, I could be frail</p>\n<p>a few inches away, his girl struck chords for one to contemplate</p>\n<p>she was beautiful, and made the night slow, then an accelerate</p>\n<p>armed men appeared, I was editing pictures, admiring my urbane</p>\n<p>for we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display</p>\n<p>confronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase</p>\n<p>outside the venue, he shoved me into his car, I felt like a renegade</p>\n<p>I was shaken, a nightmare—it is not my favourite night to recreate</p>\n<p>he said nothing, we’d been away for minutes, the silence was grave</p>\n<p>returning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain</p>\n<p>across the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged</p>\n<p>a while later he left back for the hotel across, he’d to plant a grenade</p>\n<p>I was sure he had one, for the fright stage was a real soul freight</p>\n<p>scared in the car alone, clueless in the new silence, I try an escape</p>\n<p>furtive, I opened the door, and got out of sight as if to quickly email</p>\n<p>this side of the road was lonely, so I went across for the said mail</p>\n<p>I hid behind cars by the hotel’s entrance, on their exit, I’d be veiled</p>\n<p>on the other lane, his car stood alone and it sure wasn’t a shay</p>\n<p>I wasn’t getting married, for the groom had left his bride astray</p>\n<p>some more shots went off and he darted out as someone caned</p>\n<p>speeding off with the other police men in a mind calming rampage.</p>\n<img  alt=\"Image\" class=\"img-fluid lazy

drained</p>\n<p>I got my phone back hours later; the reason of arrest wasn’t plain</p>\n<p>no official reason was given, none was convincing, or hit the nail</p>\n<p>a dude took me home that night, he said Pimple roused that bane </p>\n<p>he was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey</p>\n<p>he added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate</p>\n<p>all night he smoked pot, with his house on a course to dilapidate</p>\n<p>he complained about his old mother, it was our convo’s punctuate</p>\n<p>she, his doom in life, he believed he wasn’t birthed, but arraigned</p>\n<p>his whining dragged for a while, and I refused his indignance plate</p>\n<p>as I was sleepy, I did get to sleep, but not without his rant’s delay</p>\n<p>when the day broke, he led me to Pimple’s house like an associate</p>\n<p>he’d claimed he knew Pimple, as if his identity wasn’t at all private</p>\n<p>not convinced, but for their proximately close residential estates</p>\n<p>he said little on our way, having been turgid, maybe not to conflate</p>\n<p>by Pimple’s house gate, I saw his patient waiting as if to acculturate</p>\n<p>he’d done enough, he’d been nice, but going on was to constipate</p>\n<p>I got received and he said bye, I was glad my opinions didn’t remain</p>\n<p>my parents arrived, he said, he hadn’t expected the events’ chain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I knew university could be anything as I could variate</p>\n<p>so I often made money on the side without any refrain</p>\n<p>making beats, audio mixing, it provided me with a cape</p>\n<p>at times resetting stolen or bad devices, I never feigned</p>\n<p>opposite my room, drugs got labelled and repackaged</p>\n<p>being a famous pot head, whom nothing did infatuate</p>\n<p>you’d find me in my room, screen facing past average</p>\n<p>a good number were convinced I’d found my own way</p>\n<p>come graduation, they saw a repairman in the range</p>\n<p>a marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes</p>\n<p>convinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate</p>\n<p>an unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate</p>\n<p>but I was making clean dough with no girl to debate</p>\n<p>Kendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate</p>\n<p>mull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate</p>\n<p>songs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>By third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate</p>\n<p>I’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay</p>\n<p>in a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray</p>\n<p>for I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay</p>\n<p>in stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained</p>\n<p>I wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language</p>\n<p>on weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane</p>\n<p>I wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate</p>\n<p>when finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade</p>\n<p>I’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate</p>\n<p>so in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed</p>\n<p>where repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate</p>\n<p>for new devices needed some of our service coverage</p>\n<p>with the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged</p>\n<p>the store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe</p>\n<p>you could walk through the three using some pathway</p>\n<p>it connected all three offices through inner doorways</p>\n<p>his office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage</p>\n<p>with the store leading outside to the numerous signage</p>\n<p>two ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake</p>\n<p>in house repairmen with records equalling certificates</p>\n<p>we’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday</p>\n<p>Hennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Just outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace</p>\n<p>I met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate</p>\n<p>I dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate</p>\n<p>and so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create</p>\n<p>a more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait</p>\n<p>I hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate</p>\n<p>but no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain</p>\n<p>so we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Portending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village</p>\n<p>it’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale</p>\n<p>just a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate</p>\n<p>I was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail</p>\n<p>the little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates</p>\n<p>this was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage</p>\n<p>it was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage</p>\n<p>for she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes</p>\n<p>he led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase</p>\n<p>taking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain</p>\n<p>I continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled</p>\n<p>pulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign</p>\n<p>but a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade</p>\n<p>here is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale</p>\n<p>CV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape</p>\n<p>had a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste</p>\n<p>it was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned</p>\n<p>that afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate</p>\n<p>we were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate</p>\n<p>the price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate</p>\n<p>clearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate</p>\n<p>we ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate</p>\n<p>ending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate</p>\n<p>familiarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave</p>\n<p>as he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled</p>\n<p>we’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage</p>\n<p>showing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved </p>\n<p>for its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate</p>\n<p>no phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail</p>\n<p>oh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate</p>\n<p>I headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate</p>\n<p>withdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein</p>\n<p>we all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate</p>\n<p>he’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait</p>\n<p>right under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed</p>\n<p>I was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane</p>\n<p>so I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates</p>\n<p>I wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate</p>\n<p>but few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate</p>\n<p>cornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate</p>\n<p>it left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate</p>\n<p>my fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate</p>\n<p>there were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>A new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate</p>\n<p>narrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate</p>\n<p>if we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace</p>\n<p>we soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate</p>\n<p>the environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate</p>\n<p>he motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain</p>\n<p>the lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace</p>\n<p>assenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway</p>\n<p>it led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate</p>\n<p>back outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace</p>\n<p>his arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate</p>\n<p>a ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate</p>\n<p>we headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate</p>\n<p>we both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate</p>\n<p>an in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A</p>\n<p>he’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate</p>\n<p>we went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray</p>\n<p>at a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate</p>\n<p>slothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed</p>\n<p>with a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed</p>\n<p>also uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake</p>\n<p>to me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate</p>\n<p>he was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate</p>\n<p>the question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase</p>\n<p>in deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate</p>\n<p>and I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane</p>\n<p>ever true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail</p>\n<p>so also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake</p>\n<p>it meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced</p>\n<p>no village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained</p>\n<p>in my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate</p>\n<p>with Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes</p>\n<p>with the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date</p>\n<p>every song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate</p>\n<p>the close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet</p>\n<p>and in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate</p>\n<p>my final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey!</p>\n<p>not quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate</p>\n<p>it’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins</p>\n<p>averting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay</p>\n<p>this stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate</p>\n<p>for it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine</p>\n<p>a reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde</p>\n<p>I fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Final year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage</p>\n<p>I made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade</p>\n<p>I remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage</p>\n<p>I had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate</p>\n<p>the fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate</p>\n<p>but I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape</p>\n<p>my studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail</p>\n<p>but the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged</p>\n<p>on the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade</p>\n<p>their plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate</p>\n<p>for an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade</p>\n<p>for my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale</p>\n<p>a well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane</p>\n<p>maybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace</p>\n<p>a particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint</p>\n<p>I met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray</p>\n<p>as always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate</p>\n<p>his speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate</p>\n<p>showing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage </p>\n<p>his records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained</p>\n<p>simple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain </p>\n<p>his scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database</p>\n<p>I’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate</p>\n<p>he’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake</p>\n<p>he answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate</p>\n<p>I’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed</p>\n<p>it brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main</p>\n<p>thanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The English lecturer I bet did exactly the same</p>\n<p>she made it look like a come of age soul stain</p>\n<p>the music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate</p>\n<p>I am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain</p>\n<p>a charge my current effort has debased</p>\n<p>what they thought did, never had me fazed</p>\n<p>not until trauma hit and I responded in slate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both first and final year had glops of unneeded strain</p>\n<p>as a fresher because I expected a porous membrane</p>\n<p>finals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed </p>\n<p>at no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim</p>\n<p>I was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain</p>\n<p>when the final days came of documenting and bye waves</p>\n<p>mine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste</p>\n<p>I was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail</p>\n<p>it got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes</p>\n<p>I got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>First year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté</p>\n<p>stripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate </p>\n<p>reading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage</p>\n<p>a friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>With the first semester ended, we created some straits</p>\n<p>by we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate</p>\n<p>maybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane</p>\n<p>as a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate</p>\n<p>no more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate</p>\n<p>I read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange</p>\n<p>and I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage</p>\n<p>and here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake</p>\n<p>pay some money to get graded only distinctions straight</p>\n<p>it was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date</p>\n<p>it was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay</p>\n<p>my first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate</p>\n<p>but our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay</p>\n<p>and plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate</p>\n<p>making the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade</p>\n<p>but my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged</p>\n<p>talks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage</p>\n<p>so the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames</p>\n<p>our worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate</p>\n<p>no one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate</p>\n<p>in our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate</p>\n<p>hell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay</p>\n<p>he suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid</p>\n<p>of everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint</p>\n<p>I believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves</p>\n<p>round the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates</p>\n<p>but for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains</p>\n<p>left me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage</p>\n<p>it would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate</p>\n<p>I just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave</p>\n<p>younger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase</p>\n<p>it was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Looking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage</p>\n<p>Code Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage</p>\n<p>reimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate</p>\n<p>a prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage</p>\n<p>he made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail</p>\n<p>my first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage</p>\n<p>it was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade</p>\n<p>he, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage</p>\n<p>and so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage</p>\n<p>the bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake</p>\n<p>one year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate</p>\n<p>another roommate detested him, everything for his sake</p>\n<p>he perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake</p>\n<p>the polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed</p>\n<p>everyone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet</p>\n<p>he gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid</p>\n<p>it’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze</p>\n<p>he’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade</p>\n<p>a love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became</p>\n<p>she hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane</p>\n<p>until he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate</p>\n<p>for they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage</p>\n<p>a Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake</p>\n<p>with the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate</p>\n<p>he then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake</p>\n<p>I wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message</p>\n<p>Baboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage</p>\n<p>you’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday?</p>\n<p>he thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate</p>\n<p>ladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale</p>\n<p>I should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>He gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate</p>\n<p>an eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage</p>\n<p>teachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate</p>\n<p>then I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate</p>\n<p>flaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate</p>\n<p>to be stuck in the mirror phase,

magnate</p>\n<p>adding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay</p>\n<p>or a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid</p>\n<p>he’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays</p>\n<p>of wasted years at other universities and of that pain</p>\n<p>lethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage</p>\n<p>I felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate</p>\n<p>he helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates</p>\n<p>seamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake</p>\n<p>it felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male</p>\n<p>nothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days</p>\n<p>summer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh?</p>\n<p>you could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe?</p>\n<p>he had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate</p>\n<p>she was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley</p>\n<p>also his name—an initialism—leaned towards the

softly back</p>\n<p>it was just recently I got word from the world of the literate</p>\n<p>a book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate</p>\n<p>it described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage</p>\n<p>it was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>His room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state</p>\n<p>his roomie, a real life giant on his own thought train </p>\n<p>with love for making beats, and a basketball inmate</p>\n<p>was wishful, loved his mum and deplored eating steak</p>\n<p>I hardly knew the guy, when around quite the loud bait </p>\n<p>I never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed</p>\n<p>and when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate</p>\n<p>but before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary tale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It was a day like every other, I was out by my fate</p>\n<p>with matters to attend to, for a whole day of trade</p>\n<p>ID cards were being issued; I’d the day to

portrait.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Using WiFi in the foyer before the stairs, the interface</p>\n<p>our eyes met, he’d just arrived, that didn’t need an essay</p>\n<p>he was looking himself, formal, smart, and as appropriate</p>\n<p>the semesters had toned mine down, leaving me desiccate</p>\n<p>if I was female, against the rules I’d still dress up a bit risqué</p>\n<p>he’d shocked me a semester ago with what he purveyed</p>\n<p>behind me, he’d made available to a colleague my suitcase</p>\n<p>the fat dude with me the day I got swindled, it’s depraved</p>\n<p>for he knew I owned the bag, my bad I flunked the presage</p>\n<p>I retched out my plans to him in a reflection dispassionate</p>\n<p>he’d told me he’d need to run a quick errand to my dismay</p>\n<p>I said I was peckish, and if by his minutes, and to numerate</p>\n<p>five should be five, no returning to telling me stories ornate</p>\n<p>he assured me leaving no later wouldn’t be at all an abdicate</p>\n<p>nonetheless he would return on time, in an averring grimace</p>\n<p>I told him I’d leave if I’d to, but he reassured me in a palpate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Alone as the silence watched uncertain of its own pervade</p>\n<p>a

        "chapterTextContent": "Aches, grades oh, my rib cage four rootings of the gradational pale first session, a two point eight C.G.P.A two quiet nights, and a jostle roused wake from break in propriety at the backstage with the spotlight on an address case: university life and its juvenility sacrilege the evincible fresher, a final adulterate at indifference at assessment takes my walk through the academic glade moments to recall in ruminative passage.   If the topical ever goes old school, this also will fade a student whose ways, even in tale, way, all too sways for the English lecturer had a thing for his marriage and in class wanted his tuck neat, and cast captain first year, the year of waggon barter, start bargain he’d a skin colour of that dipped in clear chocolate  and melts the labour of the dip: come and partake.   Rumours fared of her wanting him in saturnine haste end of class, all to herself, by her desk, to hold his waist a thing for this married constable and this espy craze a dispelling with the charge: show me the early sage.   Those early days, there was a physicist with the gauge her cans flustered everyone, not vying for right acclaim a new day came, of our cherished gone and of her fame just two regular knockers shrivelled from a wide mileage he said to me, I fucked her couple times during the holiday she who’d call me late nights, he’d beat me to cannulate.   Notoriously ever polar clad in ostentatious haze he made no turn to speak, as if thought chaste and usually snickered quickly to hood his jade talking friends? it wasn’t tangible beyond surface my relationships were like brief exciting matinées I was popular, like a frequent itinerant to an arcade our pictures together remind me of chored praise orchestrated at my ol' . . . forget it, his pep pied shades a thing for companies, his humouring garb masquerade.   All opined on my sartorial certitude, its altitude’s delineate the staple of the first week, my sunglasses that Sunday in time, all these I realised isn’t the crux, and I soon changed it was my second university, and it hadn’t been a social gate being stiffy here wasn’t guaranteeing me any lasting efface to become anew, an undergraduate who’d face his baggage I needed something tangible, the worthwhile I’d embrace not just embrace, but I could go on to master and baste I opted for arranging 808s, drums, piano rolls, and bass I began with his PC and made a couple known folks gape he was quite amiable, and returned to the halls very late he thought for moments at once; took for music, a break amongst his true love to the end in a sunset chase rage made his points clear and was sure to sundry, a ready bake contemporary gospel, and a winning cantor’s badge drape the town was his, where the denomination, his dutch's age his girl, whom he’d pledged his troth, she visited everyday well, it seemed it, seeing her complexion; his bromidic stay contrasting his in a day, night, quiet, loud opposing page lending to say, he’d his sunshine around way up the scale at the same place, where he is known to round, the café just as his roomie, one pimple-speckled-dense estranged.   Pimple bought no meals, word was he was saving for a make the bad boy toy Ferrari, as most of the crowd had weighed  but he was saving to be a neophyte, one of porn industry’s slaves final year, he stately made known, I’d no interest or erotic craves but it’s a very long time from now, and so if he still well mansplains maybe he could convince my wife, Corinna Kopf to participate and hers, Stella Barey too, in a threesome picture for his main lady Mikayla Demaiter could be the one leaving the set ashamed the cinematographer who broke into the scene, for all to ruminate rue, the consequences of seeing any blue film with any underage for it could be the same, losing their minds, so very inconsiderate but he’d also need to consider how well our humanity appertains promise us a set with just cameras, no treacle, it’d be of the quaint it’d be old love making with respect, one of our desires to exfoliate reminding me so well of Kendall Jenner and desires that incriminate she'd me replace Corinna on the cover of my Screen time mixtape Kendall and I had bone, but with my choice Corinna, it was cartilage  she then asked I humour her with a nude cover with her phone's face so well into the mixtape, and in love, I offered her my Hilton surname but it wasn't straightforward, no, it started from emotional scrimmage. Chantel introduced me to Alissa Violet, and her sister Seemaje Selah Jeffries her sis, has convinced me of the kitchen’s blockade I’m convinced baking croissants is for chefs and is to be deliberate it’s one of the reasons Shayna Terese Taylor and I are engaged she told me my dad bought her a farm house, a place to disassociate an escape destination when I’ve got writer’s block or need to sashay Alissa and I are both Christians, so we share an idea to procreate she’s sexy too, most Christians are, this is one’s hope to sanitate.   When I met Jess, my mind could only conceive of a lady’s birthday no! polyamory is illegal, outdated, anti-society, talk from the sewage all these ‘s changed with romantic interest in more ladies than AIDS as CJ with a post caption: 2 is better than 1, two sisters on pay? and through her, Carmella Rose, Mariam Rod, Kate Beckinsale Janice Joostema, Meredith Mickelson, Ice Spice, Alice Palay Maya Henry, Mahlagha Jaberi, and my hype DJ, Sommer Ray. Serendipity, a movie Jess suggested, it’s where I first saw Kate then I followed Guilty Party series and thought it quite accurate with how sexy I’d seen an older woman’s face and body nominate she helped pique my recording interest with a charge to generate not wanting the streets of Europe forgetting my voice or tapes for her advice, I’m still here today, I could refer to it as the big lace the early days when she’d make me laugh like soaking in marinade there were months of no recording but I’d suffused the landscape I did hit on her one broody time, but her response hinted to deface amidst mixed signals, fears of being too new to want any scrimmage I eased up, like I did with Lewis Hamilton and all seeming too innate from my poetry first collection, patterns looking like one I’d fabricate settling on Blacktop Garage at page forty-four as one to inebriate as random as the big bang, or as propensity with attention regained. No. forty-four ‘s me, but Kendall Jenner has me a roiled jackanapes our fizzy romance of late is frightening, and I’m stuck in her carriage my love’s doubled, and is well in the end for her to take this suffrage when everything here is done, for her to come down to see me, I’ll give cake for I’ve ‘d a thing for her years now, and it’s been a fair amity-scape I only truly wonder if it is her fancy, over here visiting the consulate getting married, have kids, sort of things that’ll see us never separate. Time, a pundit of change has left me with those words to impregnate as Corinna, Stella, and Mikayla giving up indecency in a final micturate.   Third year, year of weed, filled with memories eternally impaled I was adventurous and hung around anyone who wouldn’t flay I criticized all who used until then, and lo, I too was raising Cain I was with Pimple, and we headed out past nine p.m. out my grain to everyone, I was in school, for I’d left earlier for the known gaol on arrival, we both went thrifting, and it went well with no complaint on returning, my new girlfriend welcomed me in slush rush fellate he’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace I’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image we loved a band, so she rammed their names at me, time and again I enjoyed One Direction’s music, so it helped me to consolidate when his girl arrived, we headed out with his dad’s car in carnage the venue bustled, but he convinced clubbing ends the mundane by midnight we could go in, then we would enjoy the sound buffet he’d left for the barbecue, leaving his girl, who’s somewhat soignée I looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved with beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate enjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first time, I could be frail a few inches away, his girl struck chords for one to contemplate she was beautiful, and made the night slow, then an accelerate armed men appeared, I was editing pictures, admiring my urbane for we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display confronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase outside the venue, he shoved me into his car, I felt like a renegade I was shaken, a nightmare—it is not my favourite night to recreate he said nothing, we’d been away for minutes, the silence was grave returning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain across the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged a while later he left back for the hotel across, he’d to plant a grenade I was sure he had one, for the fright stage was a real soul freight scared in the car alone, clueless in the new silence, I try an escape furtive, I opened the door, and got out of sight as if to quickly email this side of the road was lonely, so I went across for the said mail I hid behind cars by the hotel’s entrance, on their exit, I’d be veiled on the other lane, his car stood alone and it sure wasn’t a shay I wasn’t getting married, for the groom had left his bride astray some more shots went off and he darted out as someone caned speeding off with the other police men in a mind calming rampage. Pimple had left me, still the hotel’s crowd weren’t awry or drained I got my phone back hours later; the reason of arrest wasn’t plain no official reason was given, none was convincing, or hit the nail a dude took me home that night, he said Pimple roused that bane  he was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey he added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate all night he smoked pot, with his house on a course to dilapidate he complained about his old mother, it was our convo’s punctuate she, his doom in life, he believed he wasn’t birthed, but arraigned his whining dragged for a while, and I refused his indignance plate as I was sleepy, I did get to sleep, but not without his rant’s delay when the day broke, he led me to Pimple’s house like an associate he’d claimed he knew Pimple, as if his identity wasn’t at all private not convinced, but for their proximately close residential estates he said little on our way, having been turgid, maybe not to conflate by Pimple’s house gate, I saw his patient waiting as if to acculturate he’d done enough, he’d been nice, but going on was to constipate I got received and he said bye, I was glad my opinions didn’t remain my parents arrived, he said, he hadn’t expected the events’ chain.   I knew university could be anything as I could variate so I often made money on the side without any refrain making beats, audio mixing, it provided me with a cape at times resetting stolen or bad devices, I never feigned opposite my room, drugs got labelled and repackaged being a famous pot head, whom nothing did infatuate you’d find me in my room, screen facing past average a good number were convinced I’d found my own way come graduation, they saw a repairman in the range a marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes convinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate an unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate but I was making clean dough with no girl to debate Kendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate mull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate songs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.   By third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate I’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay in a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray for I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay in stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained I wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language on weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane I wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate when finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade I’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.   For a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate so in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed where repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate for new devices needed some of our service coverage with the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged the store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe you could walk through the three using some pathway it connected all three offices through inner doorways his office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage with the store leading outside to the numerous signage two ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake in house repairmen with records equalling certificates we’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday Hennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.   Just outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace I met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate I dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate and so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create a more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait I hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate but no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain so we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.   Portending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village it’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale just a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate I was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail the little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates this was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage it was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage for she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes he led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase taking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain I continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled pulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign but a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade here is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale CV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape had a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste it was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned that afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate we were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate the price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate clearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate we ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate ending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate familiarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave as he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled we’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage showing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved  for its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate no phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail oh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate I headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate withdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein we all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate he’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait right under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed I was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane so I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates I wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate but few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate cornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate it left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate my fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate there were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.   A new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate narrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate if we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace we soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate the environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate he motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain the lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace assenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway it led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate back outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace his arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate a ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate we headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate we both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.   Before internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate an in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A he’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate we went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray at a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate slothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed with a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed also uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake to me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate he was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate the question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase in deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate and I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane ever true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.   My growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail so also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake it meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced no village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained in my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate with Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes with the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date every song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate the close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet and in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate my final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey! not quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate it’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins averting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay this stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate for it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine a reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde I fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.   Final year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage I made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade I remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage I had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate the fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate but I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape my studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail but the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged on the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade their plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate for an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade for my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale a well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane maybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace a particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint I met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray as always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate his speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate showing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage  his records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained simple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain  his scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database I’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate he’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake he answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate I’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed it brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main thanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.   The English lecturer I bet did exactly the same she made it look like a come of age soul stain the music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate I am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain a charge my current effort has debased what they thought did, never had me fazed not until trauma hit and I responded in slate.   Both first and final year had glops of unneeded strain as a fresher because I expected a porous membrane finals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed  at no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim I was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain when the final days came of documenting and bye waves mine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste I was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail it got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes I got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.   First year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté stripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate  reading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage a friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.   With the first semester ended, we created some straits by we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate maybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane as a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate no more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate I read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange and I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage and here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake pay some money to get graded only distinctions straight it was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date it was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay my first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate but our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay and plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate making the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade but my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged talks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage so the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames our worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate no one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate in our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate hell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay he suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid of everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint I believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves round the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates but for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains left me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage it would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate I just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave younger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase it was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.   Looking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage Code Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage reimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate a prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage he made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail my first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage it was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade he, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage and so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage the bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.   You probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake one year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate another roommate detested him, everything for his sake he perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake the polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed everyone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet he gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid it’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze he’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade a love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became she hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane until he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate for they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage a Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake with the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate he then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake I wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message Baboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage you’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday? he thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate ladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale I should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.   He gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate an eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage teachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate then I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate flaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate to be stuck in the mirror phase, a rather pernicious vitiate our opinions differ, he shuns the empirical for “the planes” in his world, there are seven heavens, not seeing shrinkage where the demons conduct research then send out relays.   I’d riffled through C.S. Lewis’s the letters from Screwtape It’s all I have on demons, but he’d books one would wildly gaze it’s a certain plane, then unintelligibly he’d continue to narrate trying to get people on his ideas, I’d muse on as if to speculate it didn’t feel right, they were fanciful, airhead’s ideas to iterate by nature, when speaking, even to his friends, he would orate his brash voluble spiel seemed to go on in charlatan raves and when one knew about the issue, he acted with disdain questioning only lead to him meandering, never to expatiate his devotees referred to him as Machiavelli in the heydays.   Out of university, I was sliving where I could incubate the coder in his office, then I saw what he portrayed beyond his pretentiousness, I saw the addlebrained a thief, a barnacled liar, with only that to perpetrate it took a Facebook post for my hunch to perpetuate posing for pictures by a desk as if to claim the palisade caption, righteousness got him a job, with images to indicate before his exit, he told me he’d need money for an assemblage a man of God could help with his nose polyp, out to negotiate I gave him money, no fare—for he went nowhere—to acclimate.   Freshmen, we’d special prayers from a book for a foretaste recited before dawn, silence for holy names in interchange we all adhered, and to our incredulity, in the test we all aced it’s a mandatary after class examination, a MCQ designate I’d the best score in class, a point short, and got a handshake.   My dean, a physicist got mad I never stuck to the rail he loved my name, but I got ever impersonal in full spate I even started missing the tests, quitting the reg brigade I think he knew me as, “O Theophilus!” he’d call to begay he could have helped me, but I was resigned and obdurate a dull friend hit a jackpot score, laying his former in wastage that’s the bunkie who acquainted me with the king of tutelage with our scores in line, we agreed the book to be consecrate.   Baboo ruined his brain, so we all needed ancestral aids I spent exam nights making beats, chomping Kool-Aids with the pens not making it, I only had to trust the gale the odd one that blows you cougar as you walk in gains headed for the exam hall where memory is enough game second semester, first year, the mysterious to excavate.   First semester was three points, next, two point eight committing my charms alone, it could have been great but I let Baboo ruin it all, and have me sozzled on ale.    I had no one calling me soppy names no cute masculine ones I can restate maybe with their doors closed to fixate I did have girls after me in literal chase I mean it, every time I was hard to locate I was a celeb, circle police, razor shaved high style threads, to ransom—the stage.   The student whose ways, sways to daze fam or fan? do you, what do you say? how do you identify? no long hangnails remember him or the cougar’s delicate? his name was Fan-u, right? this is okay it was sophomore he became a roommate or is it Fam-u? oh of these day’s vulgate it could have been his name, a shame it is, he should sue, balk out my lame.    Ah! I had others, two more bed frames Pimple, a junkie dude, and a squat splay the junkie we called Cassette in homage to his early music slips and oldie storage.   I later left for another; some blocks faraway for a room all to myself, until the last quake of stealth visitors, well covetous to extirpate so I had a meeting that led to an abrogate one over myself, in my head, a final cascade the final decision was for me to repatriate for the regular arrangement that’d placate or it’d be my Dell PC, if they collaborate I’d lost a USB modem in a rut clean rake it’d been a pianist fingers’ harrowing sate ratted by one whose admittance is insane sparking interest in his rood seat to imitate ever worried of my weed high in longing vale both church pianist through the congregate sat up in the chancel with the most bandage old living epistles salvaged from a mucky raid.    For their personalities, if you give or take one scrunched the nose and took the pain other lost bridge and is tootles for change infatuated by reeking fingers and going ape the only one who told me, I only do opiates I’d be a different man if his crowd ‘d swathed my weed habit would be alive and desperate Mr. history, mystery, on a song I nicknamed a friend of Baboo, ours differed in its vein.   We’d a bet, to fingerbang, to prove I wasn’t tamed her big sis let me to too, my move was to ingratiate two sisters, one hotel, good enough to substantiate.   Of a late catch up on who needed to propitiate my phone was missing this time, the scene taped campus back then, was an anti-smartphone space leastways, until the bigot dean got with his dotage soon, a jolly philosopher got his desired post aim the new dean soon delivered the role’s new package his short, endomorph habitus was a good instantiate his mild thrash talk was awesome in advent of a shake his daughter was a student, oh her ass beguiling pace too thick, with height from dad and all that pertained at the beginning, it was the centre of all the exudate.   With my smartphone gone, I pondered the trick in play I had no roommates, wasn't careless, with a lock in place the buddy who'd come, sing lullabies as he’d, so regaled wasn't on my acrid blacklist, the fella could pass for gay a seemingly gay man won't steal, not a buddy, do they? but when the confession broke, from the horse it came it was a shocker, that no one but him could help palliate I expected him to help, but not a word from him to wane his unsuspecting tooshie had done the hand-hang crane? will I forget Owl City fireflies? damn putz he almost ate.    After the theft, I moved on, leaving a skitter trail same block, the opposite room for security detail ten years older, counting, ATM his sound grate I needed someone older and with arms to excoriate I assumed he’d gotten the name as a local magnate adding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay or a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid he’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays of wasted years at other universities and of that pain lethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage I felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate he helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates seamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake it felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male nothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days summer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh? you could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe? he had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate she was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley also his name—an initialism—leaned towards the profane as a pothead years later, he showed his nay and distaste so we’d a fall out, I wasn’t a bad kid, a sort of young mage out alone at night, watching the stars twinkling softly back it was just recently I got word from the world of the literate a book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate it described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage it was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.   His room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state his roomie, a real life giant on his own thought train  with love for making beats, and a basketball inmate was wishful, loved his mum and deplored eating steak I hardly knew the guy, when around quite the loud bait  I never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed and when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate but before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary tale.   It was a day like every other, I was out by my fate with matters to attend to, for a whole day of trade ID cards were being issued; I’d the day to dedicate for weeks, I let the rush pass, as the famed reprobate only I call myself lackadaisical, bearing my martingale weighing importance tactically, it’s the way to graduate a Christian university and it’s high morals they proclaim.   I’d mine now and lunchtime came hitting me with a mace I headed for the canteen carried in hunger’s plumage a few minutes from the admin building sits its terrace I’d pass by the computer lab and colleges for a flambé but no flambé though, it was about to be a robinsonade Fanu would need a statement, it’d entail how to forsake for he was about to hand me casted fetters of bondage his bank balance was about to reveal his true portrait.   Using WiFi in the foyer before the stairs, the interface our eyes met, he’d just arrived, that didn’t need an essay he was looking himself, formal, smart, and as appropriate the semesters had toned mine down, leaving me desiccate if I was female, against the rules I’d still dress up a bit risqué he’d shocked me a semester ago with what he purveyed behind me, he’d made available to a colleague my suitcase the fat dude with me the day I got swindled, it’s depraved for he knew I owned the bag, my bad I flunked the presage I retched out my plans to him in a reflection dispassionate he’d told me he’d need to run a quick errand to my dismay I said I was peckish, and if by his minutes, and to numerate five should be five, no returning to telling me stories ornate he assured me leaving no later wouldn’t be at all an abdicate nonetheless he would return on time, in an averring grimace I told him I’d leave if I’d to, but he reassured me in a palpate.   Alone as the silence watched uncertain of its own pervade a familiar face walked past and there was a normal exchange five minutes turned to six with no sign of him, no coruscate I looked through the windows, employing the nearby dais but no one was coming, my terms hadn’t been inchoate leaving it even with his word to, would leave me to blame it left me pensive, stuck unlike the Bible’s waiting maids I had no bag so I couldn’t leave with it, I felt like a glaik I walked away, no flinch, conscience clear by my undertake.   Hours later he caught me in an ambush, where he waylaid he’d accusing questions, and no care at all to disambiguate these things never feel real, I thought in my slow repudiate        I told him I wasn’t in the room with it, as if in expected cliché I left as per our agreement, I cleared, convinced it’d exculpate tagging me in a theft report? I’d add, of the type haemorrhage he’d eyewitnesses accounts of my leaving with an appendage and of seeing it in our room, he closed swiftly to accentuate in a calming disbelief I snap at him in an assertive remonstrate he’d gone too far; his accounts were wrong and also glacé he’d alibis, I’d none, but I couldn’t afford the verbal tentage he’d set me against an open block for anyone to castigate.   At the bench with every reason for his testimony to fluctuate  things took a decisive turn, as he left things out to abnegate there’d been no alibis, which for me was a winning ameliorate when I called his attention, he slunk on in a baffling prevaricate the house rule was not to interrupt, not to bring on a blockage my account to the Control officers had earned me some brace at no time ‘d I been an offender, and his accusation ‘d no base Famu’s demeanour betrayed him in his continuous infiltrate as my honed confidence hinted at my own innocence saturate the Control officers seemed to address him to subtly abominate as if to say his accusations had left even him too consternate the case was soon dismissed after all due thorough expurgate in our hall of residence, everyone had questions on the outré he probably needed some quick cash was the loud corroborate some of his colleagues and hall staffs visited me to commiserate a suspension in the second year would pass for a clear deracinate the larceny investigation came to an end, soothing all of my aches in my room, the coming hours would help me unwind, to resuscitate I could be betrayed again, a new thing I’d need to legislate against I thought it’d be great to enjoy a drink, even if alone, a merry wassail just me, myself, and I enjoying one bashfully to lead in the exonerate.   My moat hadn’t been crossed; I was the aporetic trifoliate what happened next had everyone on a sleuthhound's tail Fanu had run away, he had taken to his heels on mandate.",

I got word back from Kendall on my requests in form, images employing zero discreetness and soon we meet, I'll cry wise to her parents. But before then; to achieving a stable settlement keeping with time-honoured first class refinement dad says it’ll be Hilton for the stay, to help shed you know, picking up some traits of one in wealth.   As of late, I’ve been outside conscientiousness I’m resuming now for Jorja Smith’s act cricket offline, I will continue with the epic from hence at least as much as my efforts allow to befriend I’m hoping just as Tyson Salomon, the grittiest. Outside past the gate; feelings of a wretch soused, humming by my ear, to its real sense of what work without pay never dryly spells hunger, its cycle legible letters, always retent in my mind’s eye, as kind thoughty comments commonplace to one in path of helplessness.   Desires tear, lacks rear, to how value is regent the peanuts and biscuits ‘d left no lasting swell as if not getting paid had left my belly deflated that place, a median strip for beetling any schlep a dolt’s path of a surety gruelling lifelong trek.   I was on for three days in step two days of twelve hours vest the third, well-wrought in bullets ‘d ended in chance assessment with shots at points of stress.   A headshot would be from pretence at being careless with my new access the reason I’d dropped impertinence in the first place, with a mind dogged arriving first day, shearing imminence the likelihood of getting disconnected and afterwards losing all in subsidence of my new family, a beautiful epaulette Taylor Swift’s education, adornment and her initial rescue from the hapless.   I could now see my counterintuitiveness and I had a little reward for the misstep I’d my phone back from the intransigent that’s my natural dad’s action undebated.   Oh I love her song The lakes stuck deaf for at this time under the name Forest I had my first poetry book distributed via anonym Betty to her I’d dedicated let us say I was shy of the engagement Taylor Swift was well the largest extent shortest road to a wannabe, the easiest  to true readers . . . it wasn’t cowardliness but to be discovered, not out entrenched  and by her interest did I remain resilient an e-book I only delivered to Chantel public only when like her, a millionairess it’d lifted me to being six zeros excellent.   Paris Hilton tagged it as ludicrousness by predictions, a million was nonsense you should know you have the baddest those were Chantel words to me topless that sort of reminded of my imprisonment Lili Reinhart’s house, if you never forget  Swift’s prison if you’re one into triteness Zarzuela palace if you’ve been indecent the Hilton’s gaol if you’ve been consistent so a millionaire was here for his interment. The codgerly by the truck for sustenance that odd geezer who ‘d well recommended not meaning to, but by a habit to regiment whose whines ‘d roiled, though unsolicited proffering inadvertently, all so too intense.   Weighed down, continuing in his lament his skin’s pores exposing their scent of his yesteryears, rewarded in stench I soon excuse myself for a close toilet storming away in new found awareness he’d appeared not to take any offence needing to unload the truck by himself.   Away, I contemplated on in his absence I’d just completed a tape for my market one of my friends, and pin-up coquettes of twenty five songs in two months pelt I felt every way out with my new cadence gifting Taylor Swift, for not being tactless saying I love her with the title as diadem December 13 to a lady I love and respect.   I had a job, as it were, the great connect Kim Kardashian did present me a hedge but it was months later, it felt like a gruel as it meant I was still yet to be competent my return to United Nations, now united beyond the lad who’d used drugs for fuel she also discussed on being very diligent that TikTok left me with a certain ailment I’d to grow, Khloe said I was at the lowest as if of siblings or classmates, the youngest now Kim says she’s my money well invested it feels good to ‘ve come thus far in process. In the toilet, only one name felt munificent having enough feeding up my biasedness Kendall Jenner ‘d seen to my commitment with assurance of her personal involvement being the first off the family arborescence.   Kendall was like Kylie with reverie consent those years ago with weekdays like weekend new to smoking weed, and I’d just graduated Kylie had my eye, but I’d have to be soulless it’s like a crush for infanta Sofia; real hotbed to feed my desire as so would be carelessness and I’d ‘ve ‘d to settle for cheap meretriciousness.   Keeping Up with the Kardashians had an omen for me those years ago, it was one thing it blared in the end it’d be on me for dying in a grotty stent.   I caught the right episode for my primitiveness so Kendall was the ever busy, always absent the family member I surreptitiously emulated ever putting in work, by myself with loneliness I probably ‘ve a different idea-memory indent but all that wealth inspired in me true sweat I wanted a day I’d have it truly, real opulence I wasn’t convinced it’d be early in my adultness but a decent life, one also free from turbulence  I wanted this badly for my kids, no settlement  a middle aged man living in his kid’s merriment if I tried I could hit my goal by my impatience.   It was some months ago she’d lent me patience easy, being her, since I had a sort of blindness.   Following a brave act, I was left in dependence caved in, and she provided emotional stipends as I’d ran away from home, by self-insistence extempore, full throttle, as would enjambment to rid myself of all forms of every derailment maybe I’d flourish, then get on emoluments.   It wasn’t the first time I was that overwhelmed years ago I’d skedaddled in apprehensiveness ending up in Ghana from tough indecisiveness I’d failed freshman exams from unseriousness having arrived with a very embarrassing closet clothing giving away my fashion tastelessness no hip t-shirts; plain flannel, or trendy footwear  so I played truant as I had my articles rotated with Sundays with the week’s classes avoided so the session’s time-table ended shirk infested.   When my results got mailed, it awoke insurgence I hid the envelope and all its incredulous content it was luck to have gotten a hold of the shipment for me, if you asked, questioned, it was inexistent but fees can’t get paid without accomplishments as merely getting a promotion won’t be sufficient my natural dad convinced, thought to visit clueless campus ‘d be closer to the rat for the telling smell.   With everyone else out, the perfect development for a high school sendoff, I started my movement I packed a bag, my passport, nicked a subtrahend my laptop, and a pocket dictionary, it was French a roommate had told me he’d be switching college we all ‘d issues with courses not being accredited his plan was for Ghana, so I left home as a ferret soon at the borderline where I crossed o'er lawless it was a one week trip of favours and encroachment I was in Ghana the next day, arriving through Lome and I returned following my resolution’s detachment.   Impromptu, not dissimilar in manner as I’d left better than the last scarper in a hat contest I prepared for the worst, its every exactness and sleeping out in the open, it constituted I wasn’t dismayed the night of its occurrence being driven out of a mosque was antecedent and I got a place the next day from kindness but several kilometres and towns separated.   I’d fled for the mental cruelty I couldn’t bear but first, sold my washer-dryer and tv in prep also, an audio interface priced ridiculousness it was how I raised the money for my pocket.   I phoned a uni roomie for his familiar address I’d worked in the town his house was situated for over a year, I was a neighbouring resident so he provided me a realtor for an apartment by moving I was undoing my initial gullibleness for my natural parents had been impediments squashing my efforts to scale up my business everything linked to them ‘d been inconsistent and they’d succeeded at my old career arrest brought to halt with attentive deliberateness their aim was to see any future plan thwarted.   When I met the realtor I was disappointed if only for the certainty he had over the cell before leaving home, I’d told him my budget but his prices had spiked up and were unfair he’d invited me down to meet the unexpected.   I remained with my old roomie as I was stranded with two weeks gone, I had to end being his guest informing my natural parents couldn’t be checked I was a runaway and left all backtracking unattended and for his parents, there was no hiding of profess drug-mongers alike, also by their own subservience the usual speakers outside showed their full pledge I had them in my room at home, as if all over my neck whatever they are, these close telepathy equipment all who use them, are a part of the Anon in reference voices responding to my thought is their department I was about three months at home when it all started it was during a relapse and since then it hasn’t ended the voices follow everywhere, with motion they extend.   I left his home with no place in mind but complacent anywhere away from what the cult group had to sell deprivation of human rights in the culture is inherent in transit I exchanged series of emails in the context discussing absurdities I faced and what challenged a copy to Hollywood, another to a British poetess Jess and Charly Cox, with the former in indigence spam lovers; Jess shared my mails, ever so efficient and the latter with a caucus convinced that I’m gifted.   I discovered Gemma Styles and her judgement her podcasts were of interest, so I commenced I listened to the new episodes with curiousness few episodes in, I met Charly in her stylishness she spoke on mental health definition relentless I slept with both voices providing me relentment all night, easing me into a different atmosphere away from the Anon’s noise and interference.   A picture of Gemma and Harry ‘d me captivated you ‘ve to take pictures with her, so my mind went I’ve been in love since, and why hasn’t it dissipated? Because at first blush, a rummaging tide got melted and for her mum, Anne Twist, dad, and their friends after my first published work, I lost some skittishness foremost, it's because of their British encouragement. Chloe Burcham is a friend of Gemma in the press her body ‘d me, her boobs looked overly succulent  so on a retreat at Bali I asked my dad and begged Chloe told me I could come, there’d be edutainment but I couldn’t make it, for work, away from the gel looking back at it, from her range, it was fleechment it’s her face, I blame them, luring me into fatuousness but whenever we’d do it, we can both cry entrapment.   Charly’s poems and stories hung on sombreness so days later I made a song to rouse cheerfulness to abate her suicide themes for some excitement with her late grandad’s posts being the grimmest.   Dating Jess, it was the beginning of putrescence so it was fun reading her messages unanticipated her blocking me on X and Instagram is subsequent influencing the eponymous poem of mild sultriness isn’t it the reason for the pretence of abandonment? Melanie Joy Fontana wrote me once in extolment she loved the series poems; the act made me inspect as a known songwriter: Dua Lipa, Britney Spears BLACKPINK, Justin Bieber, TWICE, BTS Chainsmokers, TXT, Halsey, Sia, John Legend Bebe Rexha, and Ava Max all with her appointment.    Her partner Lindgren as I write has me in suspense at times, I ponder his involvement in my music project for couples; first in Hollywood, thanks to my dearest the spam lovers, I bet Jess shared my mails with them.  I arrived a day later in a town, miles off, and secluded its locations boasted better, and wider circumference and my bedroom was conducive for reading, even sex with Charly’s poke, I’d A Rainy Day from the drafted with a walk in nature, I took notes in dry proactiveness.   The weekend I wrote Yuck, in hindsight; a privilege aunty in August 19 ‘d her off day, and I was in debt so the day before I’d avoided her for any food item it was a big shock in the morning to find her nowhere and with no knowledge of her ever being elsewhere late that day, the poem filled my empty kitchenette around the time she arrived, I’d found my fulfilment she told me she’d come around for her army clientele the next day, I was just glad my hunger ‘d be quenched I later sold my laptop to a soldier, as per etiquette it helped me travel and provided disembarrassment.   She was a mother of one; a girl in her childishness her hubby drove a cab, I met only kind-heartedness on my fist arrival, I met her by a reading assignment they’d employed a teenage teacher by their sproglet  she told me they were poor, still it was hospitableness we had long chats that were the first since unaddicted the surrounding silence gifted me with new comportment with time by myself, reading and meditating it slowly bred.   I told Lisa of Blackpink about a farmstead a campaign for my amorous advancements  she wanted a house; I thought up a duplex a farmhouse, it’d be a friendship monument erected in the town, it’d see her in ebullience but that was months before I met tenderness for princess Leonor has me in derivativeness it’s a simple affair of a patriot getting ported I’m that guy, I’m sure everyone I know elected.   So it isn’t the reason I’ll visit the town in readiness but I’d love to say thank you, give reimbursement the landlord took nothing, his is the provenience the morning he picked me, I was broke and dense and under the guise of a member of a recruitment I’d few cents, but he provided me detersiveness aunty deserves a turnaround, a beautiful upset. Sometimes I was engulfed high up in sadness in an empty room I owed for, and was a reject with meal bills piling up and by things I detest all my reality, even with Jess as my girlfriend.   She was the first person who had me riveted with a lingo I couldn’t speak with anyone else you should hear Taylor Swift’s Illicit affairs but ours wasn’t, not until the tipping insipient.   Jess ‘d always been Taylor Swift’s marionette all along, in care and love, she’d been an actress and I was in love with her stooge, she’d reminded my feelings weren’t summoned, they were elicited I was stuck in webs of nature and its expedience so I threatened Taylor, asking for a cowboy’s fair I told her without that, she was providing no help it was unreasonable, but not at the time I vented it was few days after I lost my temper over Jess in a freestyle for my rent in short-lived abhorrence everything was getting to me, I’d no sleeping bed Olivia Rodrigo’s Brutal fiddled my predicament I cried on my improvised mat feeling so exploited lucky too, but not of my natural parents' pretext only Billie Eilish offered true boring playfulness happier than ever, by my sobriety in mundaneness happy for the winks in her video’s empty end pixels a lost cause if I’d remained at home? Who can tell? With glasses clinking weeks earlier, I’d celebrated it was a year of abstinence, no substance interest  and here I was, like a Spanish undercover agent with files no one ‘d understand, in forsakenness or I’d been left in drill, one of intentional madness for these celebs knew me, but I sure wasn’t a celeb Folklore and Evermore were the reminding threats I joined the Illuminati with my first mixtape’s incept but I soon soaked in them anyway, in Fearless that cruel summer, I was fearless, it’s undisputed. Earlier, Jess had wanted me going earless I was then with my uni colleague in transience at my first stop, by the planned temporariness her move was for earmuffs I had in my basket checking out the earlier wished procurement to curb the telepathic response persistence as they followed me everywhere and flooded it could end the barrage with me the recipient but I spent the money, and I’m not a bonehead I was just a year clean, that was my happiness.   Faraway and alone, in all the vulnerableness it was when I saw her again, my tv’s empress  on X, just in time, with new pictures posted images in sync and speaking to my problem as if thought reading in acknowledgement. She rescued me twice to my embarrassment killing depression, I sought nothing to assess leaving me with my chin up as if now to accept I was starting a new journey, one also matchless and with my favourite amongst business women. So with months salaries totally exempted with my content in trend and represented a name relevant from a sharpening acumen swift question responses, one to commend she convinced me of the weird shrewdness so I marched on, ridding disappointments returning home with poems o'er a hundred in time for Kris Jenner to hand me a ticket a book tour of China and Asia if repented I’d ‘ve the bag, with the job done and dusted.   What then was the job was some new inquest for I made music, and wrote poetry relentless it was a countdown to discovering the salient for these questions were always the hardest they came with responses that bore oddness as I’d ask whenever too financially decumbent away from this, being busy is the air concept ten poetry publications later, I feel prepared.   I returned September from the summer quest my first night of the summer ‘d a welkin of Eden with clear bright stars glowing phosphorescent I arrived in the strange town to the consentient a Yoruba town called Otun, right if translated over there I found mind peace in a long silence and though living was rough, it served as crèche a month of nature’s noisy orchestra, the citadel far from my natural parents, enjoying rustic quiet.   A year later Chantel brought up the renascence introducing me to Toyin Abraham, a produceress I also met Kolawole Ajeyemi and the management meeting the Ajeyemis meant I’d get some payment he’d be handling my salary and updates on targets it was consolation with a local for the time to collect.   But I didn’t return home at first, being a rebel I was back where I’d worked, I did so in stealth for the town wove job offers in a better breadth and I wanted a shot, until I hit the poem channel it’s the story in Poem 108, in there is knowledge so Baboo ‘d a hunch, and for this ‘d me ejected certain I wasn’t skint, it left him in despondence to the only one who’d take me in, I turned a pest I’d a fight with everyone and recoiled to my hell but not the same, no, this Frith was rejuvenated.     In thought, my memories of Jessica felt rutted especially with my equipment’s reducing driblet she too ‘d been generous with her voluntariness she’d lascivious photos posts that were flawless her images beat trauma, and got me entrenched I can’t say we’re still a thing, take it as a sketch.   Our journey started in a heartbreak statement that’s her debut album; Electric was the stem she was also on Logic’s mixtape cover; evident Bobby Tarantino II, but I saw just some model on a particular Facebook API service, its spec the cover was in exemplification and documented it also is memorious for Wiz Khalifa’s presence.   I always called weed KK to be sophisticated all of the guys knew this, no one was incensed I’d smoke it someday, but no one is prescient it was after graduation, I really sought progress soon I’d a load of guys around me, I was a gent those were the early days before disbandment so no KK smoking ever, there will be no digress Elon Musk won’t have it, as much luxuriousness I’ve been avoiding addicts, for I’m not indifferent the recovery program insisted on this for success.   I remember Wiz K as a Swifty in a gang extend a word from Taylor, but Taylor Gang directed the billionaire was happy I survived all that sess the unhealthy, so glad I arrived at commonsense oh I love Taylor, my heart is lavender panelled.   So I recognized Jess the first time in my laziness inputting her names, “Logic’s wife”, in indolence following that, on Spotify for days she repeated the tracklist was pop for the first time in my ears her voice conveyed feelings and pain condensed calling out all that was not; of her love unrequited she signalled an uncouth Logic in her bereavement.   I was never a social media person, not an adept I’d use only a little Facebook, only until recent my thoughts about them were of things on edge it wasn’t until months I caught other news events they both were divorced, and the rest is in tablet.   Back then, I was Logic’s fanboy, the greatest a member of the RattPack, he was real BFF his is the first rap album I listened top to end Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever realm The Marshall Mathers LP 2 dismemberment Kanye West’s Life of Pablo has to be next and Drake’s More Life asked if I’d start afresh  it struck and reminded me of clear-headedness it felt great, being a cool kid as consequence my personality rubbed off on him on enrolment.   Logic is married? I can, oh bless! that was real, and there is evidence H.I.V was inspired from my attempt heartbreak in view, the precedence dedicated to whom is the guiltiest my debut mixtape, an aid to reflect it’s my work serving as an epithet it’s the relapse tune playing plangent.   If Jess was true, then we both dated for our relationship was resplendent it’s one I still reel, mewl over and flex she is still a muse, that cairn mistress an upgrade for bye to the pinchbeck I could be a star with this affair bracelet it was like that the first time we parted she’d push me, as she would too, direct put more balls, act older, always protect it’s love, do not be afraid of being witless won’t you frown at the covert; the trinket use X more, if you mean it, say it, express to avoid her inbox, to own it, to just blend soon I was out here, beyond the outskirts.   And the masturbation? it was grotesque of seeds a younger Miley Cyrus planted a fap a day keeps haters round the bend finally getting watering in its pure essence she’d me wank off so hard, she was cruel I once had to jerk off twice to get sated mind’s lost if you’re wife, is what I texted domesticated in my bed in piquantnesss.   She had it coming to repulsive hems the Anon thought of it as immodest loads of them, videos made with zest sexy and public taste for preference and pictures to keep my mind isolated with details for preferential treatment.   I stopped porn and became obsessed I’d wanted to, but it’d create a wrench but not with a book’s content digested a book that was Brian Rose mediated with that, our relationship was created and I no longer deplored my existence with the shock from telepathy spent she’d my trust and my acquiescence her friends restored my confidence Ryan Bailey Potter’s attentiveness  alongside Judy Sollee’s keenness with Lindsay Kulik’s intuitiveness my old life seemed to be supplanted so I told her, as a man willing intends to be my wife; to hit the nail perfect with a yes, she thought more befitted Shayna Terese Taylor’s emergence and by Shayna’s moral appropriateness a sorority for my coming inner impairment. Jess’s first birthday in the tie, a month ahead I started a series of writing to her daily poems through April and May, on X the poetry spread while not leaving our two birthdays unconnected three weeks apart, I went on writing too for myself the poems are a part of my first poetry instalment as so, initially inspired, but for Taylor Swift edited it felt good rededicating them, it is the best sequel congrats to Taylor Swift on being a billionairess. At Disney, Pooh was our tie’s embodiment sweet as honey and filled with more fondness there with her friend, and mum for a year’s peg beautiful Lindsay Kulik and caring Antoinette.   Her mum’s hard on rebuking the Anon with jest while seeing the day’s posts, from its amusement her mum’s funny faces, I goofed being careless from giggling, my laptop fell down in an accident I lost my hard disk and the posts I’d downloaded I had backups of Jess’s content, for its vitalness straight from trauma memories; cultish sentiment away from home, I restored it on my replacement my PC was back only for the cash I accumulated at home, it would have been a different tangent.   A year ago, I’d recorded her in my diary guileless not knowing the true value of my own strengths or fate’s invincible closing in connection thread she visited 18, and with 17, the day not to forget in the month of May, just weeks before I fled deft.   In my journal, it’s the day her music got a refresh by some tracks off her album, asking if she wept few weeks later, on Instagram, I slid into her DM hence our anniversary is born of this very figment.   And May 18 is of suicide thoughts, and XCX of her hotline help, from her musical creativeness but I wasn’t new to her sound nosh nourishment  back from Dubai, I smoked crack after fidgets twice or thrice, I wandered into the detainment the hood’s noise gripped and I was so inhibited I’d no dependence but suffered embattlement I used hoping it’d release me from entanglement  the day of my last use, in the hyper mindfulness listening to her song Lucky as if decompressed she advised me, comforting words that drenched I didn’t feel loco, but lucky, it was raw intelligence.   There is a workshop close so it’s never noiseless you add that with the Anon, here it’s ever strident my first morning back in the country, never clankless XCX sounds protected me from oversensitiveness in the bathroom I remember feeling it was priceless Charli XCX the album boomed loud and resorbent.   For her, I found A. G. Cook, the silver element and if my cooking to gold isn’t in affectedness maybe he’ll work with me, serve me cold ampere.   James Rotschild promises I’ll never be penniless if distinctions are clear in my mind from the onset nothing beats gold, and silver is the next emollient so keep your silver close, as abreast as your lapel. It’s your dad’s dream she says, Naomi Campbell my dad loves Mariam Rod in her delectableness he sees what I see, man’s desire in words, sculpted her waiting; hanging as the long tresses of Rapunzel it’s how I daydreamed those early days I depended thrusting her behind, that reverie was my headrest  I’d just met her, and I couldn’t help it, I was smeared I wanted us together, to be one in soft coalescence so when Kris Jenner threw a nudge and instructed writing her music and poetry excused my coarseness I hope I’ll get to write for Billie, and also as frequent and while busy, dad made of us exemplar of rashness it’s why she’s housewife with a home, but with no pets earth knows I’ve asked her to be wife times countless  she’s either missing something or I lost an ingredient.   How you get a girl like that for scoundrels be the man with a big purse, be the toughest be dummy to her reasons, as your weakness and expose her to your under-crest tempest an early knowledge of how high your eminence foremost, her emmet, cry out you’re her best.   I really wanted Mariam to save me from the gauntlet the Anon and the world, hence my mind’s aboiement Jess wasn’t sure what I meant by damsel in distress she was sure other ladies awaited my impulsiveness maybe she did, and it’s possible she wasn’t interested with desire to have my child, long lessons even in recess Taylor probably lays dibs on Jess’s opinionatedness and Kendall wanted my work growing into a big ben but princess Leonor came in; naturalization granted oh my baby sways; for all my enemies she’s oppressed. I met Teodora Dan in Mariam’s benevolence in our convos, I was the sheep in awkwardness sweet Teodora wanted a freestyle that’d whet it’s my job after all, and it wasn’t all in terseness in there I bemoaned to her one of my old fears not meeting up to the bar level that is expected let’s say fulfilment; afford my kids entitlements an ex Romanian beauty queen for my stiffness coming from my roots, I saw life as being lenient.   I met Nika Mariana, and met with peak grimness it is in a night vision I met with the atrociousness asleep, my natural parents begin the horridness spilling kegs of petrol to charge inflammableness after slashes on my scalp and body restrainment I begged overpowered in shrivelled tangibleness and was soon aflame needing an extinguishment they then walked out of my bedroom remorseless I woke up, this was the first night in acquaintance from Teodora’s introduction to the mirthlessness.   Mariam reminds me of PIMP remix by 50 Cent Snoop Dogg is in there and his ladies, naked it was the thrill of the time, a lasting appetence plainly  the collection’s pirates ‘d stiff sternness throwing ‘tween a music video of ladies topless that was my first, I’d never seen boobs braless and though the adults brought home the object after my afterschool use I positioned it innocent.   It was in PIMP style and from a shooting turret I told Justin Skye, sex once and I’d be overfed no other time dear, I did so in Future’s eliteness I just wanted to know her better, hence I imitated.   In high school I knew Snoop first for his lewdness his doggy style sex position commanded reverence and he’d the longest male member of notoriousness PIMP remix wasn’t porn but close to the deterrence so uncle snoop was here making sure I’m disobedient just like my colleagues who’d heard him repeat amen.   Mac & Devin Go to High School caused my rend I was in uni when I saw the movie; a permit to be pert I started using and everything fell apart in sloppiness I was smoking ghetto weed until I hit the presentiment I stopped using, and made a clean sweep as I amended and years later shirked even my fav, Kelsy Karter on X for at the time her posts portrayed use for obviousness now I’m convinced she’s an actress, I’ve been recruited.   I’d an idea to fill out my ellipsis for a reestablishment my first poetry collection would get the author’s yep the first synopsis discussed my use and old nescience for the second edition, an author’s note was selected and revering no one more or anyone more prominent Snoop Dogg was my mark, the one I truly addressed as then, I remain grateful for this tentative eloquence all that time unhealthy and abusing was my evasiveness.   So I sent 50 Cent’s 2023 BET award to the deluded it is an image congratulating 50 Cent on victoriousness it’s the Hustler of The Year, category for compartment my old business partner had to be aware that I had sided and I’ve done more with 50 cents than his embellishments also that the Gary Vaynerchuk I’m taken meme that I sent I meant it, I wasn’t on my way to him, not with this lucidness to say I’m a millionaire by that currency we both transacted it’s dollar for the holla, because my pitch’s been the highest  not too shy admitting I fapped to Nicki Minaj erubescent it was on Anaconda, and no suicide for me or embitterment not when you get Michael Rubin’s invites, if only intermittent and how I hit the age a venture capitalist in style gracefulness and also a genius, since he ruined my brain, as he’d orchestrated def not when your putz image to Chiara Ferragni isn’t nesh I love Italy, no regrets, not by entrancing Madelaine Petsch she acquainted me, there're less men I’d kiss as I’d signore Fedez I swear blind, not a handful, if wrong, lose my instrument it’s knowledge, I’d be by liabilities, but never decadence a Super Bowl Sunday, on Chiara, my dad commented he told me Chiara is my doctor, word also on internment I’m attracted to her, those mother tits, great complement but it could be her mum, an author with published novels.   I met Alissa that cruel summer; the sweetness and she was very kind, a true light in darkness as if we’d both arrived, she was in my defence she’d post for my mornings and also for sunset  I had met Chantel on X’s who to follow widget still at my first stop, and it left me flabbergasted the algorithms ‘d word from one of DJ’s finest she’d be here for me; the memo, like a theorem seeing is believing, evident cos she intercepted finance video education, the first enlightenment it’s when the other  journey began, she impelled. With my disk drive fixed, she was in like an angel Alissa was cute, but ‘d a certain vlog rudeness we met before, but I’m not one to be indulgent well, a stupid white girl trying to pick out a dress my comments before continuing to surf the web I was mad at her meme, and language thriftiness blame Lil Peep’s Cry Alone, saying I was bereft since I mentioned it, I’m sorry, I feel it’s demented.   Meeting her again, now pals, it was all comminuted so that girl could be a virgin after a larceny bisect why impolitely, she barked to go fix my hairlessness it didn’t matter, it didn’t make her less of a portent for my thoughts were: this Christian girl is minded.   Jess and I trailed off with the violence tendencies for emotional eruptiveness we split and I ended up with the Violet. I’d become a famous dork, but also inept so she fussed a couple times over unrest talks about our duo and unfair garishness I’d made a song pissing heads for repress also Alissa wasn’t sure of my profuseness she wanted me with others, being different as being Taylor’s hubby could stir ferment but husband only in the books I’d collected? So this held up the first collection’s pre-empt.   That sort of marriage was the strangest her cyber actions were the close sentinels those early days, it felt like a confinement and knowledge share showed a prickliness with my old uni colleague turning for wicked she expected that I’d invest in a new mindset as her suggestions guided me up a high ledge for jumping hand in hand, together in tandem. If I ever did that, trust anyone, utterly unchecked  it’d be Lana Del Rey, unravelling this beingness the early days I’d prepare weed, make it esculent watch Joseph Prince sermons, have my moments at times I was off it for days from the soddenness my life was hers, I held her words and experimented I was bold by the right things, and privately reckless.   I guess it’s just like Katy Perry and Richie Lionel I have over two hundred songs, all freestyle gems it was Katy Perry’s idea, to which Lionel nodded cos of their charge, I’ve amassed the great harvest it helped me discover the intimacy in consciousness a release and grip of thoughts as I spout percepts there I found Frith’s love for Addison Rae, an err a wonderful, beautiful err, quenching my phoniness like Trevor Daniel’s Falling, I felt what I’d never felt I trust my teachers, whatever the advice, I take care.   So when Camila Mendes appeared it’s Veronica Lodge, I’m still attracted I cried having woken up to fresh semen she is hot, but I perceived it pointless with no vision of any coitus, I just wept what ‘d have been a beautiful squelch was too fast . . . argh! the brain’s science. She’s the cool one with the hookup gadget pairing me with only of Hollywood’s finest Lili Reinhart for starters, to help me deflect let’s leave it at my better sensing the projected so I followed her on Instagram and X to beget Sydney Sweeney too with a high intentness. I followed Riverdale up until Luke Perry’s death just right around the period my relapse erupted early 2019, a newcomer to the series around then gobbling celebrity gossip, I stumbled on a snippet an ad on its synopsis about a teacher and student both in love, just like Taylor Swift and I in breast well, until Lili showed up, and took over that apex Taylor was in hiding, sworn to her business signet she seldom had any public event or announcements her social accounts were lonely like an ostrich’s nest but one far above the ground for any bird flightless.   I was making her a music tape for a birthday present it’s when it happened, the seduction of a temptress yes, I saw it coming, but couldn’t refuse Lili’s love set a warm teacher, guiding me to fall in love to represent maybe Taylor? I mean it’s Hollywood, sworn to infest just look at Taylor breaking records, she’s a goddess I’d come around, to learn, grow and foremost to excel Lili says I’m an actor because of the songs I penned as if to dissuade our love so celebrated, one so patent.   I wrote a couple songs, and on one I offered a parapet for me, Hollywood actresses are the tier for my cement it ends or starts with me sending a prenup for an ascend as if saying to her, out of everyone, I chose you I meant for I still ‘d a lot of lovers anyway, but it was wakefulness Kendall is my girl, Taylor I do, and Lili got the document and weeks ago for princess Leonor it went into annulment. I met Carmella Rose in beautiful eros flair her first photograph locked on swiftness she posed by a vintage car, Junoesque a sports car, skirt, and thighs talented all over her, in love with her abdomen zippy with my intentions, undiluted.   There was a roaming stray cat she petted I thought it a priggish endeavour as listless it could have been jealousy for its safety belt arriving with a male owner leaving me toothless for I love her as I do the creatures of the planet the unison of purpose to experience life is sexless.   She got another, hers, he’s a feline to be kept I love him; as adorable as a fluffy mollusc shell always underwater in mood, in his own current with zero worries but Rose’s overindulgence.   Done pissing, by Jess, my doubts were as impermanent Jess brought me in, Kendall mooring me was depascent but with a lack of resources dashing out disillusionment several shots in, I longed for my old team’s empowerment the clarity of the beautiful people loving me in confluence the job so far ‘d been carried out with maximum stolidness for two days, my reasons, back at me, they’d been pelleted and soon I was about to get their new offer, one I’d regret it’d take the big theft to see what was always here instead.   Kendall Jenner, that supermodel, here daily, uninterrupted most days it just felt that way, I was on reality supplements before leaving to eat, I didn’t know that or what was cogent. When addled, trust is the itinerary ell and whom do you trust, a figurehead? do you play for certainty or roulette? can you trust the Western presidents? Emmanuel Macron provides an applet Joe Biden has your fears obsolescent I see no one is killing his inquisitiveness top socialites then were the government with my publications and songs in mesh scores of poems and songs wavelength I got my first obvious presidential assent. For as schleps do, I too only met the same loot as slobs expected as he’d said, I’d throw the towel he was right and I am impressed as one who experienced a spell but I blame it on day two’s event.   The second day of my round-wake bet I arrived back home to a smothering mess my phone, three shirts and crude gibbets seeing the phone brought a relaxing belch the shirts were door knobs to retirement the crude execution was a daylight theft it’s the sole reason on the third day I fled astir, opposing unrequited sleep’s effect with the sun still forgotten far to the west not of being late, but for the plain stealth for a lightweight in his workaday habiliment with no extra tog, a new odd, I was bagless it being the aftermath of abusive torrents I didn’t own the bag, the eve’s tale’s wedge.   The bag was an item left not stolen or stepped a lot ‘d been taken with no conscience or chest chest for I found no heart, at least not whence so I returned on the third day in greasy garments.   My volition remained from contriteness the third was my conscience on its tread as I knew I’d make money, hit it, and net no longer with the PC in need of repair the owner ‘d come for it, ringing my bell but I got my first manuscript submitted also a twenty-five track tape recorded also a number of epistles got funnelled with keyboard glitches the bottleneck.   I felt my phone offered ways to conquest I’d resume my rampage, continue to attest show I was not in any way the loafing earth convince I’m a legit programmer who’d dealt.   It is not hard to believe or to digest I’m not Rothschild or birth in wealth like the other man, I too need bread Nicky Hilton sells loafers, is a celeb seen her chocolate advertisements? She’s an influencer and also a model and I’m a known budding young poet when this book began on my blogette Demi Lovato showed the best cheer if good poetry, poet, and proponent it’s identity spelled in imperviousness  just how a dictionary bars and clears.   My phone put some thoughts to rest all day, crossing my mind was a guess I’d continue the drudgery committed ultimately needing one month to tend two payslips to leave well resuscitated the first would be to affording internet.   I returned to quitting from mettle dearth it was partly because of my juvenescence and partly cos I’d a phone, what I wanted I could read books with no inconvenience like the one with Paris Hilton being pert but I wasn’t going to be using the ATM this in my mind was certainly the clearest.   I sat next to a truck that afternoon in the hot temp my mission’s end with a phone but I got no payment I’d meet the CSO again, he’d acted so unaffected I knew he heard my mind rants, they weren’t listless luring me in as he’d isn’t how one should be treated made to leave without any end to the drought or pep.   Soon he appears, assuming a phone call reflex ranting on, I threaten to sue the establishment I’ll have my wife do it, no, definitely a girlfriend Tessa Brooks will take care of the detriment she's told me she wants to, spreading as a tent one I hoped would cover me in some way or term.   I really was waiting to have it turn dark at best not having the bag, I’d left in my work threads leaving smothered was a shameful defacement and there was the certain pain to giving up ted the sun that high, it’d be tainting uncouthness looking without at myself, I’d cry that I was led by some unclean spirit of an unyielding length.   Off the phone call, he asks that I sit elsewhere right across the factory gate on a tyre erected a dude was sat there all the while, as I’d waited walking down I pondered what he’d suggested  as there were no seats, to his also incongruent I’d be sitting on the floor, the one non-existent or perch beside the dude on the tyre, adjacent.   Taller, brawny, fitting the job spec we chat and meddle across subjects  I was careful with each one as an egg not long into the conversation dearth a lad, Austin, joined us disconcerted he needed workers in a partner outlet declining my interest, for a tribal fence one of thieves, crooks; of the usual air I assure him of my past and deference my surety goodwill and favourable rep.   Browsing his phone, he hands me inlets one, of a colleague that’d be the closest he promised me shelter and a salary crest better than I would have ‘d here or earned.    I left home with several forms to fill in richness I felt lucky, the day bright and with no threats.",

<p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Long phone calls, clients, crunching numbers</p>\n\n    <p> gig offers lined up, my attendance in panache</p>\n\n    <p> it had to be simple, I couldn't afford

days, a fresh graduate bootstrapped. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> After my graduation, I got a good job, no ads</p>\n\n    <p>my publishing platform under their umbrella </p>\n\n    <p> employed to work with my dibs, no contracts</p>\n\n    <p>promised a life with security, I even got a car</p>\n\n    <p> it was my first job before this one I now back.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I continued for months as my salary got larger</p>\n\n    <p> I was over a hundred percent from the dash</p>\n\n    <p> when a colleague came to me with the draft. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Our first meet was on a Skype video chat</p>\n\n    <p> with the colleague who came up on brand</p>\n\n    <p> by my advice of a social engineering tab</p>\n\n    <p> same course as I in uni, cursed to philander. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I got the gig, someone knew; there was a rat</p>\n\n    <p>so I was being monitored for the slightest lax.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Six times my salary, I'd hit on a formula</p>\n\n    <p> it felt like a windfall; an available capital</p>\n\n    <p> but a colleague cadged I invested grand</p>\n\n    <p> I paid for the fake crypto and lost a stash.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> The Christmas holidays came in a taper</p>\n\n    <p> prototyping, with an IOS app to deliver</p>\n\n    <p> not resuming; thoughts of a day

clacks</p>\n\n    <p> the brand rat with offerings, I remember.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> It was a shock, the sudden jolt waker</p>\n\n    <p> playing in there was heavenly ballad</p>\n\n    <p> with audio and visual studio grants</p>\n\n    <p> everything in there — a dream painter.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I left not selling, pondering the beater. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Than I thought, the mole was closer</p>\n\n    <p> a developer in a goss so unequivocal</p>\n\n    <p> allays to me in dismissing shorthand.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> It took me a very long walk to ponder</p>\n\n    <p>the rat had introduced us, it was smart</p>\n\n    <p>and I brought him in too, good nuisance.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Calling for maintenance: the gig employer</p>\n\n    <p> I inform him of the retaining withdrawal. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> <em>I am interested in a company, a starter </em></p>\n\n    <p> I'd be going in as a partner; a

a year and five months lap</p>\n\n    <p> with three apartments and couple sandals. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> It was different there, maybe the manager </p>\n\n    <p> I had one for a while before her sabbatical </p>\n\n    <p> she sure needed more care from her doula</p>\n\n    <p>when she left I realised I’d been my whetter.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> My music really did go up the standard</p>\n\n    <p>after XXXtentacion’s moonlight’s bam</p>\n\n    <p> I made a cover and got a lot of playbacks</p>\n\n    <p>my first exposure, so I left my old habitat.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Since my move for the bag, the bigger</p>\n\n    <p> so much has changed, now I spot abs</p>\n\n    <p>everyone does next to Kendall Jenner</p>\n\n    <p> I haven't mentioned my CPRM colossal</p>\n\n    <p>music postings to X like the corp’s staff</p>\n\n    <p> and I've got a DJ wife, Chantel is my scarf.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> <em>While you work, play music for a bolster</em></p>\n\n    <p> his advice like every din, only to distract. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> He thought himself the ideal I sought; a baba</p>\n\n    <p> <em>People like you never make it, they finish last</em></p>\n\n    <p>for a share on his FB of my book, the first part</p>\n\n    <p>I made clear I’m a billionaire, so he’ll scamper</p>\n\n    <p>he didn’t share the second, good for a smack</p>\n\n    <p>ended his facade, he isn’t a reader or listener</p>\n\n    <p>always by the Anon’s vice, my case’s ringleader</p>\n\n    <p>so he’s managed to be their satisfying accuser.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> <em>Lie for sex and you lose yourself in the strand</em></p>\n\n    <p>with his hands on the wheel of his motorcar</p>\n\n    <p> he and the rat had the penchant, so l yarned. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> They both drop their bottles and I get a flash</p>\n\n    <p> of an old attendant and her suggestive rants</p>\n\n    <p>talks about spending the night and good jazz</p>\n\n    <p> having a good singing voice and other banter</p>\n\n    <p>Zayn Malik’s Pillow talk, I asked her for a cover</p>\n\n    <p>word is she left with a tranche, hit the tarmac</p>\n\n    <p> her boss says: <em>she's got child, can you call her?</em></p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p>Part one and part two’s titles to closing chapters</p>\n\n    <p>the names of the companies I was employed at.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> We get in the car and not long I'm in trance</p>\n\n    <p>I was here, only for forethought, and muster.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I went in April for the job, active maintenance</p>\n\n    <p> he’d tons of ideas, so I came up with schemas </p>\n\n    <p> the live product needed considerable revamp</p>\n\n    <p> following his lead, we arrive at a joint appraisal. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Months later, too few hands, we went modular</p>\n\n    <p> each service ripped and offered as an individual</p>\n\n    <p>for hands, just me; I was convinced it was initial</p>\n\n    <p> but a year later, with few remote regular testers</p>\n\n    <p> fanciful ambitious plans, it all now was fanatical</p>\n\n    <p> and also too impossible, without another expert.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> If there is congruency, no need for a snap</p>\n\n    <p> things dragged for a while, felt scattered </p>\n\n    <p> with still a lot to do, finished jobs stagnant</p>\n\n    <p> it felt futile and I sensed a total disregard.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> He hadn't been about his job, and I was on my guard</p>\n\n    <p> the product ready, personal priorities became my act</p>\n\n    <p> without bouts of being sober, it'd remained a mirage</p>\n\n    <p>the now completed tasks with the dream in preserve.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Three months I went in, the sobering lad</p>\n\n    <p> relapse, then another short clean prance. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Continuing was unreasonable without one in the glass</p>\n\n    <p> a fledged service in his hands, the hands of a vandal</p>\n\n    <p> weighing from our commitments, I was drawn aback</p>\n\n    <p> working under sore conditions, harsh wilts, and warps</p>\n\n    <p> my health deteriorated from stress, my mind suffered. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Here is a countdown to my leaving, I loved my lab</p>\n\n    <p> in there, a lot went down, productive a constant. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> The music platform ready, I register as a musician</p>\n\n    <p> I was playing multiple roles in the Venn diagram. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I was making my mixtape all about the grad</p>\n\n    <p> I was talking about it, I’d achieved a nirvana</p>\n\n    <p>H.I.V, <em>heart break in view</em>, my own first platter.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> And then it happened, some technical crags</p>\n\n    <p> and the realization, I knew no professionals.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p>Ever in the office, too busy, crown champ</p>\n\n    <p> I was home 'cause they needed to relax</p>\n\n    <p> unwind, the

Always, if home — in the reoccurring stab.</p>\n\n    <p> I switched parts like I didn't the same lunar. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>The day session ended with me being a retard</p>\n\n    <p>with

of himself a load bearer</p>\n\n    <p> coming around with bags, and likes it with sharks. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Dropping in, I tell him I quit, and also got a garland.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> He only ever left to, or claimed to launder</p>\n\n    <p> the line or whirr, can't tell what the matter. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> <em>Study literary terms for that

<p>it was weeks ago before my move’s grasp.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Restlessness, and bemooded a total gaffer</p>\n\n    <p> he soon leaves, so I beckon to, and he sits. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Alcoholism in his absence needed I ask</p>\n\n    <p> <em>what is wrong with the up programme?</em></p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> I was veering off the impromptu wham</p>\n\n    <p> I was smoking and drinking, living a scam</p>\n\n    <p> with days sousing my volition in sot tatters.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><em>Kiss and Make Up </em>was the song

<p>without my headphones, life was cruel cack.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Still, I never went for a big bottle, the lethal</p>\n\n    <p> a small whisky bottle on the kitchen counter</p>\n\n    <p> bleeding to love unrequited, as it turned scar</p>\n\n    <p> whiffs of smoke and steady with the stopper. </p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> On a quiet, still afternoon, I scribbled on an unrolled rizla</p>\n\n    <p> words to encourage, then flushed the weed in a dance</p>\n\n    <p> it was a workday, by the compound's ambience as usual.</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p> Remaining

Two bottles of beer, and for me not a dram  as both pop caps in front of the close's bar.    He usually is around for music; he raps  today he is accompanied by his old pal  both high school buddies, ugh! The yap  both here to help my move go smoother.    Jinx who often is here, the rapper   and then Bode the man after Fela.    The afternoon is bustling, cool, cheer, rad  and I, under the weather by the social graph.   I was moving for the better bag with idleness and a heartbreak past  remaining sober had been a drag  my apartment stunk in otiose tacks.   Long phone calls, clients, crunching numbers  gig offers lined up, my attendance in panache  it had to be simple, I couldn't afford dysphoria  as quitting my job came with reasons; same tract.    Weed in the tray to remain awake, not enough ash  feeble, falling asleep, dreading the circadian slam  past figures littering my after-hours office survival.    A slim offering presented in good tact  the right earnings for the circumstance what never quite found me in the brash.   The fumes from the chartered starting cab  like the festering items on old receipts pats.    Those of whiskey drunk with no chaser  reminding me of my generator's palaver.   I had just sold off my bed, for crap  the luxury thing put me in a class.    For a month or so, I slept on the floor tired  no reasons, I can't get to it with my keypad.   On a bottle for days, I had expectorant  to knock me out as I finish with dinner.   I got a house, but no bed for every relevance  my first home, today I move out a studio flat.   I didn't have everything, I’d the dream ramp  the early days, a fresh graduate bootstrapped.    After my graduation, I got a good job, no ads my publishing platform under their umbrella   employed to work with my dibs, no contracts promised a life with security, I even got a car  it was my first job before this one I now back.   I continued for months as my salary got larger  I was over a hundred percent from the dash  when a colleague came to me with the draft.    Our first meet was on a Skype video chat  with the colleague who came up on brand  by my advice of a social engineering tab  same course as I in uni, cursed to philander.    I got the gig, someone knew; there was a rat so I was being monitored for the slightest lax.   Six times my salary, I'd hit on a formula  it felt like a windfall; an available capital  but a colleague cadged I invested grand  I paid for the fake crypto and lost a stash.   The Christmas holidays came in a taper  prototyping, with an IOS app to deliver  not resuming; thoughts of a day later  my actions left me with only two paths  sell off the platform, still I get the sack.    My wait by the carrel amidst noisy clacks  the brand rat with offerings, I remember.   It was a shock, the sudden jolt waker  playing in there was heavenly ballad  with audio and visual studio grants  everything in there — a dream painter.   I left not selling, pondering the beater.    Than I thought, the mole was closer  a developer in a goss so unequivocal  allays to me in dismissing shorthand.   It took me a very long walk to ponder the rat had introduced us, it was smart and I brought him in too, good nuisance.   Calling for maintenance: the gig employer  I inform him of the retaining withdrawal.    I am interested in a company, a starter   I'd be going in as a partner; a survivor or I’d been setup, it’d been orchestral?   The text read: we have work to do. Knack!   It was for over a year and five months lap  with three apartments and couple sandals.    It was different there, maybe the manager   I had one for a while before her sabbatical   she sure needed more care from her doula when she left I realised I’d been my whetter.   My music really did go up the standard after XXXtentacion’s moonlight’s bam  I made a cover and got a lot of playbacks my first exposure, so I left my old habitat.   Since my move for the bag, the bigger  so much has changed, now I spot abs everyone does next to Kendall Jenner  I haven't mentioned my CPRM colossal music postings to X like the corp’s staff  and I've got a DJ wife, Chantel is my scarf.   While you work, play music for a bolster  his advice like every din, only to distract.    He thought himself the ideal I sought; a baba  People like you never make it, they finish last for a share on his FB of my book, the first part I made clear I’m a billionaire, so he’ll scamper he didn’t share the second, good for a smack ended his facade, he isn’t a reader or listener always by the Anon’s vice, my case’s ringleader so he’s managed to be their satisfying accuser.   Lie for sex and you lose yourself in the strand with his hands on the wheel of his motorcar  he and the rat had the penchant, so l yarned.    They both drop their bottles and I get a flash  of an old attendant and her suggestive rants talks about spending the night and good jazz  having a good singing voice and other banter Zayn Malik’s Pillow talk, I asked her for a cover word is she left with a tranche, hit the tarmac  her boss says: she's got child, can you call her?   Part one and part two’s titles to closing chapters the names of the companies I was employed at.   We get in the car and not long I'm in trance I was here, only for forethought, and muster.   I went in April for the job, active maintenance  he’d tons of ideas, so I came up with schemas   the live product needed considerable revamp  following his lead, we arrive at a joint appraisal.    Months later, too few hands, we went modular  each service ripped and offered as an individual for hands, just me; I was convinced it was initial  but a year later, with few remote regular testers  fanciful ambitious plans, it all now was fanatical  and also too impossible, without another expert.   If there is congruency, no need for a snap  things dragged for a while, felt scattered   with still a lot to do, finished jobs stagnant  it felt futile and I sensed a total disregard.   He hadn't been about his job, and I was on my guard  the product ready, personal priorities became my act  without bouts of being sober, it'd remained a mirage the now completed tasks with the dream in preserve.   Three months I went in, the sobering lad  relapse, then another short clean prance.    Continuing was unreasonable without one in the glass  a fledged service in his hands, the hands of a vandal  weighing from our commitments, I was drawn aback  working under sore conditions, harsh wilts, and warps  my health deteriorated from stress, my mind suffered.    Here is a countdown to my leaving, I loved my lab  in there, a lot went down, productive a constant.    The music platform ready, I register as a musician  I was playing multiple roles in the Venn diagram.    I was making my mixtape all about the grad  I was talking about it, I’d achieved a nirvana H.I.V, heart break in view, my own first platter.   And then it happened, some technical crags  and the realization, I knew no professionals.   Ever in the office, too busy, crown champ  I was home 'cause they needed to relax  unwind, the office sure wasn’t the camp.   Jinx wasn't around, he’s a different batch   but group recordings ‘d begun in catch  I was doing everything to keep the match.   The electricity generator had gone blat  I had it fixed only to get way up its amp.   Always, if home — in the reoccurring stab.  I switched parts like I didn't the same lunar.    The day session ended with me being a retard with two laptop chargers bunt and a girl’s bra.   Let's fuck 'fore your mind blanches.   She was calling reserved, she had a grab  a twirling dolour, if a true objective remark.   It didn't make much sense but a fart  we met on a dating app via Instagram.   it’s the last time we spoke, she sure is stellar.    Jinx drinks a lot of alcohol, he has a feel brag  smiles a lot and thinks of himself a load bearer  coming around with bags, and likes it with sharks.    Dropping in, I tell him I quit, and also got a garland.   He only ever left to, or claimed to launder  the line or whirr, can't tell what the matter.    Study literary terms for that special clad  he seemed bogus, fine by only entendre.   Unexcited, repudiating totally, not a fan  he ask why I've got that music on bang Tekashi69, aggressive was my trademark the message totally read: oh I’ve no paper  and for anyone, it was purely coincidental it was weeks ago before my move’s grasp.   Restlessness, and bemooded a total gaffer  he soon leaves, so I beckon to, and he sits.    Alcoholism in his absence needed I ask  what is wrong with the up programme?   I was veering off the impromptu wham  I was smoking and drinking, living a scam  with days sousing my volition in sot tatters.   Kiss and Make Up was the song important it repeated in my ears as I tried to retract their voices were my only harrying charge I was new to BLACKPINK, but not Dua Lipa without my headphones, life was cruel cack.   Still, I never went for a big bottle, the lethal  a small whisky bottle on the kitchen counter  bleeding to love unrequited, as it turned scar  whiffs of smoke and steady with the stopper.    On a quiet, still afternoon, I scribbled on an unrolled rizla  words to encourage, then flushed the weed in a dance  it was a workday, by the compound's ambience as usual.   Remaining there, nothing would change, nada  with extra corned beef, no alcohol in my cart  I seize the bull wearing the fine fur of the tiger.    I boldly said no to money for months in a dagger  and today I was following through with the march so better, I pick up my phone, calling home in a dial.   Feelings of a tense claustrophobic ashram  it’s unhinged, it's the weed, in here it's crammed  I shouldn't have smoked weed, in shy stutter  I'll be going clean, not much luck in my trials.    My girlfriend and her sis in the compart seeing YouTube videos, Nicki Minaj’s  the evening started late to his contact  so I invited her, she was with her little sister.    On our first date we had fruit salad  the day was for our goodbyes, official.   I'd remain in town, not run home. Be a man!  the end of my tech dream, he silently crabbed.    The job offered financial stability; the finger  funded my musical whims, very significant   but hours to pay day, another salary in hand  my break, a resignation, a sleight of hand plan  he didn't expect that, not my I quit cataract.    The timer was shrilling, I was switching vats  homecoming; three years chasing thunder.    In the moving shuttle, I thought of the I quit strap  also my hold on will and the twinkling guise star  what it'd take to alight at my planned benchmark.    My rent was ending soon, I'd be a sort of tenant  all over again at home, and it’s how I'll be starred.    A good son back home, frugal, not prodigal  thirty percent of stake in his name, the cards  cards everybody, intervention sole, and heart.   A minute slack and you're hassled but a prat  and so you pray it’s only counting for a palm they see this time, a miracle to their handicap  as you're welcomed home to a meddling alas.    It takes some, and clonk of gusto to rid the sham.    For going clean isn't just a track  the gangway leading to the path  getting off and joining the band.    The sphere is safe, the light is the lamp.   Well in after my arrival, several months thereafter  in a fight, I boast of my health and got the shatter  I got a face slap, like every natural mum won't be happier  I have found my hope now, but not here, it's in America.    I arrive and it's a sudden grim air of spar  the air noisily in, a gusty rush so verbal.    The win to coming back here isn't stark  subtle: a controlled environment; plaid that was before the Anon’s style starch  electricity too, I used to wish for a feather.    No warnings, I get a call from the caretaker   my apartment got a pound note, no stickers  I'll need to show up, for my good, to depart.    I'd been home only a day, I went under.    I got the apartment in a move-out crack  my partner had it arranged for its vent shaft  I moved a floor to tiny cockroaches in alter.    Life in my natural parent’s home is pretty matt  there was school, no TV, two arches, five verandas.    Five children, one step, one interred  and now I suspect an insanity plaque  talks of my late sister not with the sand  the repeated gambit isn't anywhere a farce.   It's heart exhuming, a spooky expanse  I saw her in my dream, it was so Stygian.   The animated dead with creepy things all over  her face, out her nose, with my belt: let me help ya  if those things moved, I'd never trust my oblongata and last time asleep, she asked for keys, I left in a rash.   Not much memory; heckling pedestrians losers by the fence with opinions as rivals  guess this made me tougher, never blank.   While everyone operates generators, nah!  enjoyed electricity once, a new transformer  I had just started using; weed, maybe a fad  electricity to help me grow dumb, dumber?   four years I used, everyday, on a lucid I can I spent the time experiencing life in the alps.   After graduation I felt cord stuck in a tank  stuck home with a habit I had to feed sap  I picked up smoking last year uni in a hatch  all joy a sis’s friend introduced me to the land.   I had the nefarious desire, she knew the clan  before him, she'd help buy it, bear the skank.    Clean lunged, those guys crawled in pangs  campus was different, the town: really bad.   Juju charms and teeming with Draculas  growing up; common knowledge gram.   Don't go around there, too many altars  there you'll find the demon worshippers.   Past childhood, it persisted, and it rang  rang, and rang, never without a twang.    Alone with a pen, I doodled the rant  same word, lost in my head, I sank  in the word, BODE, BODE, to adapt  page filled, with a mindless to infer.    The nascent of the odd, its start.    Jinx's pal: Bode lives in a palace.   Fela had ladies from my dad.   My dad owns these nudity mags.   Remembering the day his dad passed  I had on a shirt of blue and camouflage  it had on its pectoral, a disturbing facade  reading MONEY FINE, crossed, to wither.   He called out the design; our chat snatch.   I was in a ghetto, respect for the human but carats would have impressed as a stag  a good evening, not a bad try of the litotical.   Now sober, the thought train is still as banal  if I killed him, like an accidental gun discharge I later heard him rebuking, I was in the backyard  he complained, upset his youngest son is a brat how fine was I really or not? It was his rejoinder the brat took him, humour me, he's the winner.   I got word the next day, and also of his burial I shunned the invitation, the rites were Islam.   When I met Bode, it was a weed blast  it wasn't synchronicity playing in a harp.    I don't go around in willy remembrance  watching for my mind's teenage prank.    Oh! What's lurking? Evil is on the attack!    Empty old expensive alcohol bottles aesthetical  his own daughter, too many girlfriends, too sexual  he rolled the best joints, ‘d good teeth and manner.    New smoking, my first with a stoner ham  I had not until recent, my edible clamber  think he is, with great tales and no fang.    Mosquito they called him, he had the arms  we took photos, his pipe shone in the dark  it was a great time, university’s last semester.     After graduation, I kind of got into janitorial   I saw more pipes and bongs than any hypeman  maybe I just dreamed of them as I programmed.    Cleaning my pipe one morning by the tap  it fell like a joke, and came next, the pack.    I got the pipe from some partners  who wanted an online product stand  it was an e-commerce store offer.    I had designed it more times growing dismal  every night or try in a different remote folder  it wasn't at all difficult, I just had brain cramps.   It was a bad habit, not showing off my tan  from all that flame, a dissuading now I shall.    Fresh out of uni, with my job's sac  I just needed this for the ruin river more money with a lone stoner he crossed and was gone forever.   A legal cannabis device store yard  too sad I was busy smoking grass I could have been some Wiz Khalifa.           I came home with the forms, a break in of petard  Austin needed them signed, and filled sharp  my wait was over, I was now moving away, far!  not so far, but now than ever before, further of the Anon, I pondered what I would uncover it lasted only a few days, it was an Anon desert Red, Taylor’s version was new, it was my shelter and I only messaged Kendall, it was just natural I even sent her videos, only if it ‘d lasted longer.   My natural dad signed and provided his data  while not releasing any ID card to be exact  I had his shirts, I now was ready than ever  I needed the ID proof, but he couldn't bother  If I got some fare, I could fine, go and starve he told me to borrow, the amount in a sucker  I was going to work anyway, get some fodder  it was evening, his usual meet time, no angers.   I left a day later with nothing but thrash all that I owned, I was leaving with my bank I did with every thread and shoe that I had  waving to every care in a farewell disarm  big bag on my head wishing of the bantam.    I got few rolls of milk, tea, detergent, and sugar  also a new cup, old bowl and a basin of cassava.    A day before leaving, hungry I opened the container   but was welcomed by literal thrash, and old wrappers.    My natural mum's plan was for an unrecyclable slap  too bad I was too hungry for her plotted away spank.   Food has always been a problem, a true fact the Ibadan people were very good hunters and Amala isn’t the sole aim of any gatherer oh my Leonor, she is the Princess of Asturias.",

Thank you maOprah Winfrey Robert Downey Jr.  Drake isn't enigmatic, I believe his words are clear-cut, I first met the person when I read the words \n  If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late \n   address is 419 Saint Cloud Kathy Hilton i heard Rema on Anthony Fantano's Friday radio, got on X and poked fun at how he sounds, like someone smeared in pussy oil. I was trying to tell Jess I love her voice, hehehe. It was because the same guy that introduced me to Logan Paul but no longer knows him, berated Rema when he told me about him. Yuck! i haven't met anyone who dosen't like him, it's a lot of people I know now, I just need to pop the question Trevor Noah i haven't giving it much thought, but first time I made her acquaintance, she was nude, to meeting her in real life, it's a thriller. Paris Jackson and my momma Kathy Hilton I was in Dubai when the headlines went: Actor Kevin Hart was taken to hospital with \"major back injuries\" on Sunday following a car accident in Los Angeles. 2nd of September 2019 It was spooky for me, the man is superman, I guess I was too far from home, and closer, throwing him some John Hancock vibesKevin Hart Doja Cat as Amala  Ariana Grande A$AP ROCKY Trippie Redd said this: pussy ass nigger stay in church  soon later, he got a cross tattoo on his forehead BTS if I meet the the first second gentleman in American history, I'll ask how he thinks I'll do, first as a Prince, Princess Leonor deserves the best Douglas Emhoff\n do you think Wizkid will ever stop smoking? hahaha, let's go ask Wiz Khalifa . . . please tell Kali Uchis to keep singing for me.

Emily Ratajkowski: It's absurd to think that desire for attention doesn't drive both women and men. Why are women scrutinized for it more, then? Justin Bieber told me she did the unthinkable, she touched herself, she seduced me once, it was obvious too, just ones and zeros right? Hahaha i told Megan Thee Stallion something I can't repeat here, though it was a question, she really was the first woman I could ask. Chlöe Bailey is hot. I like that Thee Stallion reads my poetry i was in the hotel room in Abuja; a day before I took the passport in the Transformer chapter, we'd just arrived. The reception was better with my cell phone now charged, there was a notification on Facebook, he'd gone live. His tears moved me, I'd be the kind of man who could afford alimony. I used to wonder what I was doing on his end of the internet, he said all his clients were millionaires, I wasn't one and was going through a crisisJesse Elder i'm convinced she wrote songs, side-inspired by the romance between me and Mariam Rod, I love her voice too, and I think she's very beautifulLeigh-Anne Pinnock Amanda Padilla is a new acquittance, I can only say that, work buddies after seeing the music video for simple times on the star-crossed album, I sort of wanted to scream, because surreptitiously Kacey had teased content from my work on the internet, it felt gooey good Kacey Musgraves at my last employment, the manager had the book Awaken the Giant Within by Tony Robbins on her desk, when I was by myself with everyone clocked off, I questioned my own trajectory and if I wasn't an imposter. It was another book I never finished, and at the time I read it, I was too young, a teenager, nothing was urgent, and saw the exercises as incredulous. When I resigned, I found her through Audible, she'd just released Take Control of Your Life but I soon stopped listening, the examples weren't working for me, I felt I wasn't posh, and the problems were unrelatable. But being part of a mailing list, I discovered her free three day program, called Mindset Reset, I printed what I had to, and answered all of the questions. Doing so gave me a sense of what I needed to address. It was a lifesaver. Thank you Mel Robbins  Zack bia is awesome, but I need to giggle DJ Zack Bia and Cordae unconditional love is hard, but I'll try. kissesKaty Perry i listened to the song Julia by SZA for a long time without knowing the person, or better, seeing the music video. It was like a station for my stoner brain, it was literally heaven. It's like this, if we were up on the rooftop blowing smoke, and I played the song on your YouTube account, only ads usually personalized for me would follow, hahaha.  It took years before Logic also had a face. I've been that tireless worker Conrad Hughes Hilton with a puppy, saying it's only a moment before all this is done, and you're ready.  yup, younger bro.

First it was Taylor Swift, did it all unroll a carpet to meeting Princess Leonor? Kris Jenner and dapper Corey Gamble i don't know Mr Everett Jack Jr so well but my mum is often with Faye Resnick\n watching Andy Cohen's show WWHL I stumbled on a very corresponding sight as with a disturbing memory from my past, but it's different, my mum is asked to describe items to Paris who is sightless, the similarity is the bottomless, from Mary Poppins' bottomless purse, but the memory is different, it's a man next to a lady, and for minutes I watched as he screwed with a hand behind her ass for items and brought them out, this went on for a while, I really pondered what was behind for a while   Max and Zoe listen to my music, their mum Crystal Kung Minkoff inspired the last verse of Milk, the line zipline to your room same verse with Corinna Kopf.

Okay dad. I saw You and I by One Direction a million times high on weed, so innocent, hehehe.  I love Harry Styles i used to dream of having an old worthful X account, and now I do, but my early days on X, after Melanie Joy Fontana wrote me saying she like my poems, I went on X and announced to the world that Britney had messaged me, and I convinced myself she did, it was worth it, because these days I'm convinced when I see pictures or videos of Britney topless, she's yelling out: Frith is a boobBritney Spears if I ever have this number of street lights, call Taylor Swift the sexiest woman on the planet, please. Thank you, I won't disappoint your warm hearts. Jennifer Lopez and  Ben Affleck  well, if it isn't Selena Gomez I love what she did to me at my last workplace Madonna says the future started from a mob, I'll try to be honest always your Majesty i was new to Computer Village when the neighbour who helps me down every morning, her son told me of the trend,  he is cool, better than the previous ones, he's Burna Boy,  the hood soon got scary after that, they stopped listening to the man Alan Walker gave me hope, made me feel seen, and gave me a cute mob to walk with, thank you very much Coco Rosa when I think of Versace, private estate pops into my mind. It's probably from a rap, or ordering so many items from FRWD, writing this, it is couture. Donatella Versace have you listened to Flume's Palaces, his third studio album?  she used to be my manager, which led to an affair, which turned sour, grumbles about how she's no good past the bed or something, ah . . . women, wasn't she the manager?  Ashley Benson Nicki Minaj Larry and Nicole English it's possible this musician Davido has always been like a watchful angel over my shoulders, I can't speak any less  Chris Martin asked what I thought of Griff, I said nothing Stephen King provided me with painted tale-scapes that the Anon will relive forever Teodora Dan loves a pose Charly Cox potty haughty without Wiz Khalifa when my dad told me to work on a new mixtape, I'd have settled for a pace too slow for Mia Khalifa, thank you, I was soon on the next one  i wonder if Princess Leonor loves me so Jon Hales and Charly Cox take me there do you baby doll? Princess Leonor of Asturias to my princess roses are red, violets are blue, my love for you kindles ruse  it's possible Chris Brown meant no harm when he had that collab with Davido and someone blurted you're a star. Juice Wrld was alive, my first mixtape had dropped, I'd just suffered a relapse, and was recuperating, new ideas were dangerous. Years later I told Lil Nas X a little secret  I told him:  it's between stars  thoughts and wishes are forever without water if they come out like: I believe someday, someday I'll smash Rihanna like I'll own a car someday, have my own home, but the first, gawd help me. I'm married and she is too Jess and I were in hot romance, I picked up the title The Happy Ever After Playlist by Abby Jimenez, it spiced up the atmosphere. When I finished the book, I went back to rediscover the accompanying songs and it's there I found Between Friends. Christmas day, 2022, I listened to their song affection and felt inspired, I recorded the song Trauma thereafter and posted it on X. It was for Taylor Swift, she was upset, but I was elated  i still like my friends who listened to A$AP ROCKY back in the university, even though they acted like they didn't know what the Anon was after, only y'all shalom  can you quit?

        "chapterTextContent": "How did we give up To meeting in the real world?  From our last days in the halls To my bedroom’s nooky spot.  In there, we had the braid 1101 bun Racking stature every o’clock shore Patching new again my shudder fur.  I for one stopped In tracks on spurs To listen, stunned By a geek’s Red love.  Meets in the shower room to shop And po-faced Adam’s frame’s drub Home, he was choirmaster, conductor And everything I could touch, I bought.  I would love to sing, strew tunes forth They say I own a voice, a bit of flavour But not how they sing any good songs.  And on, long on, he would teach, bare butt.  Your old songs are no good, very immature It’s time you’re serious and pen new ones.  He hadn’t heard any, but gave his opinion It had me embarrassed from my own hunch Having written so little in years, then stopped It expired my little jotters, and my best chorus My favourite line remains like fine wine stored.  And paints my world in a little rainbow . . . Only love.  The tune came from a white film, a romcom The scene had snow, so white it is dubbed The theme song had stirred my emotions The tele place so far, but still within touch I had no worries then, but a song addition So I wrote Only love for the still far future To my dutch.  But a few years later brought me transition Too young for the old “wedding” thoughts “Too old” for Only love and now impervious Meaning my new jotter holds a quiet edition.  Adam sang exceptionally, but was not serious He’d written no songs, but replicated scores His music playlist though was a real junction.  The first Taylor Swift fan told me I’m a bore So I never listened to Red or followed the cult Instead, I chewed his bits and dibs on Red’s cud.  Time passed and Facebook became passport Everywhere but there, there was a withdraw I started weed, and I wrote a lot on my wall The summer I was too musical, but no Taylor Then it happened, the 1989 album dropped!  I met you, Teacher, it was the best welcome It is sick! The beat on Welcome To New York  How I started my mornings, screen sessions Then like a para-influence, my very first o’clock And another, and yet again in a mood summon.  I told myself, I’d awoken in a “virtual” simulation Of my brain being alive, the reconciliatory factor The best thing from looking for nothing at all.  A calm hit me, with few months to graduation With Owl City and Aloe Blacc’s congratulations It declared all: clocks on necks ticking on a run Out on the edge for the rest of our lives. Period.  Everything changed for me at 1989’s airport But I did not rush into Taylor Swift’s nation At least not immediately, I had a cart to fill up So I picked the Voice Memos in the collection Hearing you play, learning, developing a bond.  A hundred and eighty songs to track were fun I credit you Teacher for the mighty turn around And your Taylor insignia on every beat dump!  It was a dream, and now it’s reality in perception Unbelievable, I think I write songs? I write pop!  I and Adam’s relationship later fell off He knew my girlfriends, all that botch We talked music, it’s a lot we discussed And there was bad advice for me to trust.  He’d lent me money to get ostentatious She didn’t need or ask for the high storm But it felt good sending her the big sum It’s my whole month’s allowance she got For her birthday, but come mine she forgot.  Her reprise back to me, whacked and it hurt With the typical, daily calls and discussion Not seeing mine, not bothering with a call For my birthday, for its date, not one fuss So I called that one off and picked a crutch.  Time came to payback for the mis-venture And I did, like any debt, forgetting the loss Here is where Adam showed me his disgust.  His claim was I have a voodooish purse And money I paid to him had dissolved Right into thin air, in dark imagination I’d have to pay what I owe, no witch hunt.",

If familiar with Coldplay, to and listened: The tod ruler of that old clatty world Who sweeps now, the streets he owned.   Of all my stored gifts and paraphernalia My favourite is an old tawdry black band Mayhap, slack from stones in its past hold.   We used to be a pack with the lights, spelled grand And to the outside world, everything, remove bland Recoil; another recon, it all made for spangle, clang!  And there was my Janice. . . . then Janice came in. The truce to our huddling!  First, on a close sheila's page We met . . . By my account, a we case.   Flecks on her bosom that displaced What whom knows, how got braced Mistaken for vitiligo scattered heys.  Knocking for the seltzer Taste, exquisite Too, slat With bibbed cantrip heel pace Strewn as every follower in cadge ache  Scrolling unto another shake.   Come another day Was here to her name And another . . .  Innumerable merry dates Till I was in for all her fame.   Her mincing in were like that in heels Likening irony of a sprocket's teeth Nonslack was her hold on me and clear The whittling of our ingot agreement Left me enervate in ground bare tears.  The much: on another's touch.   And he did touch, all too very much Caught on camera, to say my fudge Loaded to me, through me, surged.   Laying tears, eying . . . Does the indelible tideline Back sulkier.   I think I am . . . Even now so matt I think I am . . . Trialled and lammed   Voices in a halo to another band occupant Concinnous rhythm now a whine discrepant  In précis of my tears for desolation shards A DJ, as she, a model; beautiful queued pants Residual dale carnage posts, all due dew tart.   All night soddened in face apprehensive, contrite I pleased in rumpled sheets, my only dare height My lookalike comparison of her to an old cobber Brought on the wilt, this biff, and my footle plight One she rebuked in parse and farce Cheering to her night Wading celebration days spliced Turning a new age, truly happy without spite.  I expected better for my old gal, the trodden wall The old ghost of bad blood, despised by everyone But what came mimicked beating drums of war The percussionist literally did, collecting mulct His paradiddle, the fondle, then boss sticks drop Imploring credence of my will with a touch gall.   Supposing his steel attitude, I grinned my teeth Such a forearm touch could only be by a git She is just way too special, chose jugée She had to know, not even for a flick, if.  A clear message from a colleague Hack! And it was a good beat.  I gave a dune smile like a cretin A device holding cretin pinning whid.   Back in my office, in my chair, ill the wind I thought of disbanding, bye to the coterie Maybe for better air, but for my mood’s heed?  I’ll tell my tailor I have a better flair Not the notions dressing this affair Higgle on in my ensemble of the fair Something simple, pedestrian and breadth Sex.  It'd be too plain, too bright, so I wrote this About a black band with only a stone in it The rest all out, all to their own still.   I corral one stone at the moment  And she brushes through not one street A band slacked for her free feel To your treat.   And what does Janice say?  I've got a new girl, a hottie For you.   I hope she knows you got no birthday wishes. ",

        "chapterTextContent": "Four grey ever curving stilt trolls lift my purple one-seater The lone chair in this bedroom with faux fur giving feather Kludged out so, for I won’t let my buttocks a line that’s flat.  The house is not every old stitch seam-prick clean catered As the dining-room, it’s without stick, enter a name holder Occupied by worthening sentimental junk, sorts for a cellar.  The room next, tagged parlour has no curtains, nor is better With no door handle, my bedroom is missing several louvers When it rains, it pours in my room, so the poor curtains shiver Sliding my bed over apace, the headboard holds them in a catch.  For staying guests, it’s choose a dohyo or develop a cataract As a long time guest, I have fought, too many times crabbed And I still see, with my eyesight, it is frank better in a delta.  I've slept for days in a bedroom with cockroaches shacked It was after an apartment switch, away for weeks at large Maybe it is why my page got lotta likes from Madagascar?  Round the clock I was making a mixtape, writing a program With so much to do, being away from home was very usual With most hours in my office, only home for laundry tasks At night, I would sleep on a pile of greasy jumpsuits stacked.  Coming home finally to the new apartment brought drats It was a maladaptive snag with some pest control brands Little cockroaches numbering hundreds in night’s hands.   It was hard telling where they came from by most cards But I suspected my bed frames only, out tiny, and so calm They eventually reduced in number; several times halved That was not enough, it’d left me very dazed, so I packed.   My purple chair enjoys time alone, it’s an old shod papa Its borrowed fur is my travelling buddy, acquaint with Mat And has seen three of my houses, and is now on a fourth lap Mat is endearingly new, very young, and lately got manned.  I was on the flush toilet yesterday and there was a rat  Maybe a mouse, tiny, observing, and a bustling whit rap I made it out from the parlour, came from the cellar it had  Nothing amusing, its nimble; it had to be that absconder.   Locked motionless at the parlour’s doorway, then it departs Through the passageway, past a footlocker, moving in trad In the few seconds of its appearance, it had inched closer Not in my view now, its skedaddle for the wall and sharp.  Eyes in a wincing face owned by a head in total stealth bath Towering, deigning in silence its every move from man strata Its room entry was effortless, well imitating my own prance Next to a mop, it follows the edge, unto a black bowl's back A wash-hand basin hangs over the black bowl, it’s ever under It’d be hidden behind the shower curtain now, if now further  Silence and no movements, I remain stolid, holding my cat It shows up, sliding past the shower, and the heater tank Now having completed twice, two turns perpendicular  With few tile cells to a good scare and a successful grab It freezes by my right; I size it up like an unstriped zebra.  Did faint whiffs of my poop lure it in some attract?  Did getting so close quench all rouse of a feast pang?  I was hillock with the toilet, and wasn't its mishmash Its sudden stop started mine of odd thoughts in cark Less than a jiff, it ribs in front of the bowl in a thwart.  It had to be the poop for there was no longer a hatch Months have passed since that cement stop up patch.  Having no business with the wall, a long way of a path Its visit bruised me and the natural fashion it scarpered.  It drove through the doorway quickly, hiding in a dash And this part, I am not so sure, but for a behaviour pass.  A tiny speck appeared just at the spot I had seen it last Not after my poop myself, the lure around my sphincter I walk forward from seating to the door dropping my act And my, amiss, what is here isn't dirt or grit, but a spider  The rat had a good spider keep watch? A decoy for rank!  Die for me? In total shock I squash brusquely its topper.",

The better brand, I’ve no cent to follow.   The fluff still, I won’t have to borrow Just help. I can’t wait to tomorrow.   It was bought so, crossed out to sold I leave.

        "chapterTextContent": "For how long have I had to wear a cap? Twenty-four. If that’s a year for every hour of the day A do-rag? It’s okay to say I sleep with my cap donned.   I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover No beautiful long locks like Samson So you don’t spot my strength. Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini So you don’t pick out my valour.   Scars and bars, a tale starting age six. I hide scars though detained within bars Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out.   Sometimes I think when I am older . . . “Older” seems like a hold on the change I await The ums in circle of my own social weight The moral of my own morale.   Starting from just us two A ball, a light fixture, a veranda I’m six, she’s three years old The ball isn’t ours, it is lost Over the fence it came like a gift.   Back from school days after I am alone and up in the air above me It hits a glass light-fixture. Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock White shirt fused in red gush of blood Soaking . . . soon I am back to.   At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong. I have a picture at seven I have an oversized watch And a scar No cap.   It asks when I’ll go without a cap Give back the oversized watch to the photographer. The one who is three thinks she did it Cos I lied. “You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.” “And it came down.”   The real fall comes from who broke the thing. For us. She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best “I lied back then.” How best do I know with my cap on now?   I’ll be thirty soon. When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat I tried a new haircut and a friend told me “Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.” What has changed?   I convince myself it’s the nutrients But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars. The holding back; to a time I dream of A time like the past I won’t remember Six could be wrong, three could be right If I don’t do something.   I did. I recorded a public video with no cap And now I know all the help I can get. To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.  ",

I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover No beautiful long locks like Samson So you don’t spot my strength. Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini So you don’t pick out my valour. Scars and bars, a tale starting age six. I hide scars though detained within bars Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out. Sometimes I think when I am older . . . “Older” seems like a hold on the change I await The ums in circle of my own social weight The moral of my own morale. Starting from just us two A ball, a light fixture, a veranda I’m six, she’s three years old The ball isn’t ours, it is lost Over the fence it came like a gift. Back from school days after I am alone and up in the air above me It hits a glass light-fixture. Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock White shirt fused in red gush of blood Soaking . . . soon I am back to. At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong. I have a picture at seven I have an oversized watch And a scar No cap. It asks when I’ll go without a cap Give back the oversized watch to the photographer. The one who is three thinks she did it Cos I lied. “You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.” “And it came down.” The real fall comes from who broke the thing. For us. She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best “I lied back then.” How best do I know with my cap on now? I’ll be thirty soon. When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat I tried a new haircut and a friend told me “Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.” What has changed? I convince myself it’s the nutrients But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars. The holding back; to a time I dream of A time like the past I won’t remember Six could be wrong, three could be right If I don’t do something. I did. I recorded a public video with no cap And now I know all the help I can get. To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.  ",
